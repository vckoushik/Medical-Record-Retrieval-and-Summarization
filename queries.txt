Eligible       volunteer patients were recruited to participate in a double-blind clinical trial within 21       days after the onset of the acute event. One-half of the patients were randomly assigned to       a beta-blocking drug propranolol and one-half to a placebo. The trial also evaluated the       effect of propranolol on incidences of coronary heart disease mortality, sudden cardiac       death, and nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary heart disease mortality in persons       with documented previous myocardial infarction. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND:        Survivors of a documented myocardial infarction are recognized as having a high risk of       dying relative to the general population. Serious arrhythmias, occurring with or without       evidence of new infarction, are a common cause of death in this population. Theoretically,       an agent which 1 can block the sympathetic nervous activity thought to be involved in       precipitating sudden death and 2 has non-neurogenic antiarrhythmic properties would be of       value to people with coronary heart disease. Propranolol, like other beta- blocking agents,       has these as well as other properties and therefore might be expected to prevent or retard       complications of coronary heart disease such as serious arrhythmias. This would be reflected       in a decrease in mortality due to coronary heart disease.        A workshop on chronic antiarrhythmic therapy reviewed contemporary experimental data and       clinical practice and recommended that a clinical trial be undertaken to clearly show the       effects of beta-blocking drugs on mortality. Subsequently, such a trial was approved by the       Clinical Applications and Prevention Advisory Committee, by the Cardiology Advisory       Committee, and by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council.        The study protocol was reviewed in February 1978 and recommended for approval by the       policy-data monitoring board and ad hoc members. The protocol was approved by the Director       of NHLBI in March 1978. Recruitment started on June 19, 1978, and ended in October 1980. A       total of 3,837 patients were randomized. Units which participated in the trial included 32       clinical centers, an EKG center, a central laboratory, a coordinating center, a 1-hour       ambulatory ECG center, a 24-hour ambulatory EKG center, and an EKG tape quality control       center.        DESIGN NARRATIVE:        A randomized, double-blind design with single experimental and control groups. Patients were       recruited while in the hospital for an acute myocardial infarction and were enrolled in the       study before discharge. Eligible patients fulfilled the study definition of an acute       myocardial infarction. The diagnosis was based either on electrocardiographic records       showing evolving QRS segment changes or on ST segment and T wave changes together with       enzyme changes and appropriate clinical history. One-half of the patients were placed on       therapy using a beta-blocking drug propranolol. The other half received a placebo. The       prescribed maintenance dosage of propranolol was either l80 or 240 mgs/day, depending upon       serum drug levels. Intervention duration averaged 25 months. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Men and women, ages 30 to 69. Documented myocardial infarction. ");

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND:        The nature of essential hypertension as a mass public health problem throughout the United       States, and internationally as well, is recognized generally. Prevalence estimates exceed l5       percent in most adult populations. Further, the results of the Hypertension Detection and       Follow-up Program HDFP demonstrated the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy even at the       90-l05 mmHg level, which comprises 72 percent of the total hypertensive population. The       Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure       recommended treatment of mild hypertension by pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic therapy to       the lowest diastolic pressure consistent with safety and tolerance. The recommendation was       consonant with the goal blood pressure guidelines for those with baseline pressures from       90-99 mmHg. Hence, there appeared to be a growing consensus that reduction of blood pressure       to levels as low as 80 mmHg might be desirable for optimal cardiovascular health. The Joint       National Committee further recommended that, in young patients with uncomplicated mild       hypertension, the benefits from pharmacologic therapy must be weighed against the cost,       inconvenience, and possible side effects. There was, therefore, a growing concern over the       need for pharmacologic management of hypertension and the public health implications of such       a course of action. These recommendations toward intervention in mild hypertension set a       firm basis for the primary prevention of hypertension.        The association between obesity and elevated blood pressure was widely recognized. Among       hypertensive individuals, numerous studies had shown that short term weight reduction by       caloric restriction resulted in a reduction of blood pressure. Results of several reports of       long-term follow-up of weight reduction efforts indicated that long-term control of weight       at levels compatible with the objectives of the HPT was feasible. A number of investigators       had achieved these levels one or more years after treatment despite minimal intervention       efforts during the follow-up period.        There was strong circumstantial evidence relating sodium intake to hypertension. Most       impressive evidence came from the study of the low-salt tribes, subsisting on a very low       sodium intake. They failed to develop hypertension, or even gradual rise of blood pressure       with age. Many studies published on the effect of lowering sodium intake on blood pressure       of hypertensive patients had been positive. In one investigation, blood pressure fell       approximately 9 systolic/6 diastolic mmHg when sodium intake was reduced from       approximately l80 to l00 mEq/day. Reduction of sodium intake to a level of 70-l00 mEq/day       appeared within the capability of most people and maintenance up to a period of two years       had been indicated with minimal follow-up procedures.        The role of potassium intake in the development and treatment of hypertension was less       clear. As noted above, primitive cultures studied epidemiologically had low sodium intakes       associated with low prevalence and incidence of hypertension but these cultures also       consumed higher levels of potassium. It has been suggested that the ratio of sodium to       potassium may be the most important determinant of blood pressure. Hygienic intervention to       increase potassium intake in free-living populations was the least studied of the procedures       used in the HPT. Potassium intakes > l00 mEq could be achieved without the use of dietary       supplements if individuals consumed large quantities of fruits and vegetables. This natural       intake could also be increased by use of potassium-based baking powder and seasonings.        The study was carried out by four clinical and two resource centers a Coordinating Center       and a Nutrition and Educational Resource Center. It was to be Phase l of a long-term       intervention trial to determine whether development of hypertension could be prevented in a       population at special risk. The initial phase of the study was directed towards testing the       feasibility of the intervention, alternative modes of recruitment, quantification of sodium       and potassium intake, trends in blood pressure, and the pre-testing of various study       procedures.        Each of the four clinical centers recruited 200 or more eligible 25 to 49 year old       individuals total 841, either identified through any of a number of multiple community       sources, or through an index of hypertensive cases. The clinical investigators aided by       statistical and data processing support from the Data Coordinating Center and intervention       support through a special Nutrition and Education Resources Center, formed the collaborative       group to test the working hypothesis. The study protocol was completed in the fall of 1982.       Recruitment ended September 30, 1983. The three-year follow-up period ended August 1986.       Analysis of the data ended in December 1988.        DESIGN NARRATIVE:        A randomized, non-blind design with three treatment groups non-obese or five groups       obese, including a no-treatment group in each weight stratum. Intervention methods were       dietary only, and included sodium restriction, sodium restriction plus potassium       supplementation obese and non-obese, weight reduction, and weight reduction plus sodium       restriction obese only. This was a pilot study with measures of feasibility including       recruitment success, dietary adherence, and blood pressure differences among the treatment       groups. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Men and women, ages 25 to 49. Diastolic blood pressure between 78 and 89 mm Hg. Free of         major disease.

This information will be used to develop a database on normal movements and       adaptive movements of people who have diseases that affect the way they move. The database       will serve as a tool to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with movement-related       problems.        Volunteers over the age of 4 who have normal movement patterns or who have developed       different ways to perform movement tasks may be eligible for this study. A physical       therapist will screen candidates to determine their strength, flexibility and range of       motion of joints.        Participants will be asked to perform movements such as walking, walking up or down stairs,       standing quietly or reaching for an object. For the test, the arms and legs are wrapped with       a soft, rubber-like material to which small plastic reflective balls are attached. A piece       of firm material called a shell may be attached to the rubber sleeves or other areas of the       body. Then the volunteer performs the specified task several times while special cameras       record the movement. The cameras only record the positions of the reflective balls during       movement, not the person s face or body. Electrical activity in the muscles also may be       measured, using small metal electrodes attached to the surface of the skin with an adhesive       bandage. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The purpose of this study is to develop a database of normative and adaptive control       strategies for human motion. Up to 900 volunteers will serve as subjects after they complete       a neuromusculoskeletal screening exam. Subjects will be asked to perform one or more tasks       related to the execution of activities of daily living such as: walking on the ground,       walking on a treadmill, quiet and perturbed standing, stair ascent and descent, turning and       jumping, cycling, elliptical training, and isolated upper and lower extremity limb movements       or trunk movements. The subjects movement patterns will be recorded using a       three-dimensional motion tracking system. Motion data will be analyzed using a rigid body       six degree-of-freedom approach when applicable. Temporal/spatial, kinematic, kinetic, and       surface electromyographic variables will be collected and calculated.        Many factors affect the ability to move. The ones we are mainly interested in investigating       include muscle weakness, spasticity, and dynamic balance. To quantify strength or       spasticity, a force transducer is needed such as a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer which is a       standard rehabilitation assessment and training device, or a more simple handheld       dynamometer can be used that the person presses against as force is recorded. For the       spasticity tests, a person or a machine such as the Biodex moves a joint through an arc of       motion e.g. elbow, knee, or ankle at a range of speeds from 5-240 degrees per second while       resistance to motion is being recorded or graded subjectively. EMG and joint position may be       collected simultaneously during the passive movements. The dynamic balance tests will be       performed on a force plate or using a clinical balance testing device, the Equitest, by       Neurcom. To determine if electrical stimulation ES improves limb movement, walking, and       balance, a device such as the WalkAide may be used in patients who have some dysfunction in       their lower extremities. Only persons with central nervous system injuries who have a foot       drop gait pattern will be given the opportunity to use this device for 3-6 months. The       WalkAide is worn below the knee and delivers individually programmed ES to aid in muscle       function of the ankle.        Patient groups will be identified clinically or statistically. Group means and standard       deviations will then be computed. It is hoped the database developed may serve as a tool by       which individual patient data may be compared in order to facilitate the diagnosis and       optimize the treatment and clinical outcome of patients with movement related problems.        An over ground harness system may be used for some of the over ground or instrumented gait       and balance assessments if there is concern that the patient is too weak or unbalanced and       therefore may trip or fall during the activity, or to help facilitate more normal patterns       by decreasing the load borne by the trunk and/or legs. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       -  Any volunteer of any age from birth to old age who is deemed medically fit to              participate and is willing to provide their informed consent will be included in the              study.

Researchers are particularly interested in two conditions;          1. Spasmodic dysphonia          2. Vocal fold paralysis        Familial vocal fold paralysis can be a life-threatening disorder that can cause difficulty       with vocal fold movement for breathing and voice and sometimes for swallowing. Studies are       ongoing at the NIH to better understand the pathophysiology and to relate it to the genetic       pattern of inheritance. Families are being recruited to participate in these studies and are       being provided with further information on the disorder and genetic counseling if desired.       Physician referral is requested for affected members of families with vocal fold paralysis       of an unknown cause occurring over at least 2 generations. All travel, lodging, examination       and counseling costs are covered for both affected and unaffected members of a family.       Examinations include: voice, laryngeal, neurological, electrodiagnostic testing, genetic       counseling, and radiological studies.... DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       OBJECTIVE:        Our purpose is to examine for evidence of genetic risk factors associated with idiopathic       laryngeal motor control disorders. During the conception of the protocol, we were interested       in investigating the pattern of inheritance of familial voice disorders, specifically       spasmodic dysphonia and tremor. Interestingly, the initial search for families revealed       several large families with idiopathic vocal fold paralysis with some family members       experiencing symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia. During subsequent years, the research has       focused on inherited forms of vocal fold paralysis in an attempt to determine the       relationship between the laryngeal motor control disorder and other associated neuropathies,       and to determine the existence of a specific genetic abnormality. These idiopathic laryngeal       motor control disorders were one manifestation of peripheral neuropathies or may be an       isolated disorder with only laryngeal involvement. Subsequently, we have shifted our       emphasis back to the identification of genetic risk factors for spasmodic dysphonia.        Hypothesis 1 Familial risk factors for spasmodic dysphonia result in a particular phenotype       and genotype.        Hypothesis 2 Environmental risk factors may differentiate between affected and unaffected       members of families with spasmodic dysphonia.        Hypothesis 3 Whole genome screening will identify SNPs associated with the occurrence of       spasmodic dysphonia.        STUDY POPULATION:        Families with multiple members affected with spasmodic dysphonia, vocal fold paralysis, and       tremor will be ascertained.        DESIGN:        A pedigree will be developed via a questionnaire and voice history. Affected and unaffected       family members will be examined to determine the presence and extent of their laryngeal       motor control disorder. Affected family members will also undergo neurological examination       and nerve and muscle studies to determine the loci of their pathology. A genotype will be       developed for affected and unaffected family members, through DNA testing of blood samples.        OUTCOME MEASURES:        This is a natural history study characterizing the phenotype and genotype of idiopathic       laryngeal motor control disorders. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:          Symptoms present during speech and not apparent at rest,          Symptoms less evident during whisper, singing or falsetto.          Symptoms become worse with prolonged speaking, practice or anxiety.          Reflexive and emotional aspects of voice function are unaffected, such as coughing,         laughter or crying.          EXCLUSION CRITERIA:          Any patient with a history of airway obstruction will be excluded from the study.          Structural abnormalities affecting the larynx such as vocal fold nodules, polyps,         carcinoma, cysts, contact ulcers, or inflammation laryngitis.          Reduction in vocal fold movement range during non-speech tasks such as whistling which         would suggest either paralysis or paresis, joint abnormality or neoplasm.          No smokers or tobacco users will be included in the study.          Subjects with history of a psychiatric disorder, under the care of a psychiatrist, or on         medications for treatment of a psychiatric disorder will be excluded from the study.         Examples of psychiatric disorders to be excluded are: somatoform disorders, conversion         disorders, currently under treatment for a major depression, or a history of schizophrenia         or a bipolar disorder. However, a history of a previous episode of a minor reactive         depression would not exclude a person from participation. ");
INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00001853","TITLE:       Diabetes and Heart Disease Risk in Blacks SUMMARY:       It is unknown if obesity contributes to the development of heart disease in African American       men and women.        This study was created to determine whether there is a relationship between sex and body       size and the incidence of heart disease in African American men and women. Researchers will       attempt to associate obesity with the presence of heart disease risk factors. Risk factors       that will be studied include; total body fat, body fat distribution, fat content of the       blood triglyceride concentration, low density lipoproteins [LDL], and high density       lipoproteins [HDL], how fast fat is removed from the blood, and how well insulin works in       the body.        Scientific studies have shown that obesity and increased levels of fat content in the blood       are important risk factors for heart disease in Caucasian women. However, similar studies in       African American women have failed to show the same correlation. In fact, it appears that       African American women in all three body weight groupings, nonobese, overweight, and obese       experience high death rates due to heart disease. In addition, prior research has shown that       obese African American men tend to have elevated levels of fat in the blood while African       American women have normal blood fat levels. Therefore, if high levels of triglycerides fat       found in the blood are not seen in non-diabetic obese African American women, it cannot be       considered a risk factor in this population. This suggests that studies conducted on       Caucasian women may not provide insight into heart disease risk factors in African American       women.        The study will take 120 healthy nondiabetic African American men and women ages 18-50       grouped by sex 60 men and 60 women and body mass index 3 subgroups; nonobese, overweight       and obese. Diabetes undeniably increases the risk of heart disease. Therefore patients       suffering from diabetes will not be included in the study. Candidates for the study will       undergo a series of tests and examinations over 5 outpatient visits. Subjects will have body       fat analyses, resting energy expenditure measurements, an EKG electrocardiogram, and       specific blood tests.        Researchers believe this study will provide significant insight into the causes of obesity       and heart disease in African Americans. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This study is designed to investigate in blacks the relationship of risk for diabetes and       heart disease from obesity plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations and the       triglyceride related risk factors of small dense low density lipoprotein LDL, high density       lipoprotein HDL and central obesity.        The Framingham Study demonstrated that obesity and elevated glucose and triglyceride levels       are important risk factors for coronary artery disease in white women. However, studies that       have had significant participation of black women such as the Charleston Heart Study, failed       to show a relationship of obesity or triglyceride to coronary artery disease mortality in       black women. In fact, black women independent of body weight or triglyceride levels       experience high mortality from coronary artery disease. Our earlier research has       demonstrated that obese black men have elevated triglyceride levels but obese black women       have normal triglyceride levels. Consequently if elevated triglyceride levels do not occur       in obese nondiabetic black women, then elevated triglyceride levels may not represent a       major cardiovascular risk for black women.        The study, Diabetes and Heart Disease Risk in Blacks, is designed to determine the role of       obesity, glucose and triglyceride on risk for heart disease in blacks. For this study of       blacks, we will study 2 groups, African Americans and Black Africans living in the United       States. African Americans must self-identify as African American, be born in the United       States and have parents who self-identify as African American and were born in the United       States. The second group will be blacks living in the United States but were born in Africa       and whose parents were born in Africa.        We will recruit 1132 healthy, non-diabetic individuals 546 men, 586 women, age range       18-65, and body mass index 3 subgroups: nonobese, overweight and obese. We need to recruit       more women than men because triglyceride and glucose levels are lower in women than men.       Therefore a larger number of women are needed to see an effect. In 3 outpatient visits to       the Clinical Center, participants will have body fat analyses, an electrocardiogram, an oral       glucose tolerance test, questionnaires about sleep and stress and an intravenous glucose       tolerance test. This study has the potential to provide significant insight and lead to the       development of programs that help decrease diabetes and cardiovascular risk in blacks. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:          Ethnicity: African Americans          To enroll participants must self-identify as African Americans and be born in the United         States, with American born parents or be born in Africa with African born parents. In the         future, we plan to expand the study to include other groups which self-identify as African         Americans i.e. AfroCarribeans and Hispanic blacks.          Age: The age range of the participants will be between 18 and 50 years.          Medical History: To participate in the study subjects should identify themselves as         healthy.          Menstrual History: Women must give a history of regular monthly cycles 24-35 days for at         least one year.          EXCLUSION CRITERIA:          African American Ethnicity other than American or West African ancestry. In the future, we         will expand the study to include other African American groups such as individuals of         Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic blacks.          Medications: People who take medications that are known to alter the parameters which are         under investigation in this study will be excluded. An example would be medications used         to treat hyperlipidemia such as statins, niacin, bile acid sequestrants and fibric acid         derivatives. Subjects on thyroid hormone replacement will be included if their TSH is         normal.

This disorder, which is an involuntary shaking, usually of the       hands, has no satisfactory treatment. It affects more than one of every 100 people in the       general population, with the figure climbing to nearly 4 in every hundred among people over       40 years old. In animal studies, 1-octanol reduced chemically induced tremors in rats. This       study will test the effects of the accepted daily intake of 1-octanol 1 milligram per       kilogram of body weight on essential tremor in humans.        Patients with essential tremor 21 years old and older who wish to enroll in this study will       undergo eligibility screening with a medical history and physical examination that includes       tests for thyroid, liver and kidney problems. Participants will be randomly assigned to       receive either 1-octanol or a placebo an inactive substance. Patients in both groups will       have an intravenous catheter a thin, plastic tube placed in an arm vein for collecting       blood samples during the study. Those in the 1-octanol group will be given a 1-octanol       capsule; the placebo group will receive a look-alike capsule containing no active       ingredient. Neither the patient nor the doctor will know which patients are taking 1-octanol       or placebo until the end of the study.        Tremors will be measured once before the catheter is placed, every 15 minutes during the       first 2 hours after taking the capsule, twice during the third hour 30 minutes apart, and       once again after 5 hours. The tremors are measured using procedures called accelerometry and       surface electromyography. For these procedures, electrodes are taped to the skin; needles       are not used. Blood samples will be collected once before taking the capsule, every 15       minutes for the first hour and a half after taking the capsule and again at 2 hours, 4 hours       and 5 hours after taking the capsule. Vital signs blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory       rate will be measured every 15 minutes during the first 2 hours of taking the capsule,       every 30 minutes during the third hour, and again at 4 hours and 5 hours.        Participants will stay in the hospital overnight for observation and return after 3 days for       a follow-up physical examination, including a blood test. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Essential tremor ET is the most common movement disorder; however, there is currently no       satisfactory drug treatment. The neural mechanisms underlying ET remain unknown. One of the       prevalent hypotheses is that ET is a result of a defective mechanism that normally dampens       the natural oscillations of inferior olive IO neurons whose intrinsic oscillatory activity       is attributed to the presence of low threshold calcium channels LTCC. 1-Octanol is known       to inhibit LTCC of olivary neurons and was found to reduce the tremor induced in rats with       harmaline, an alkaloid known to hyperpolarize IO neurons increasing their tendency to fire       rhythmically at rest. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of 1-octanol on ET in       humans. This study is designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose trial in       untreated patients with ET. Electromyography EMG and acclerometry are used to assess       tremor before and after 1-octanol administration. The accepted daily intake ADI of       1-octanol 1 mg/kg/d as a food additive will be given as a single dose. Toxicity from       octanol will be monitored clinically and by liver function and electrolyte measurements. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Patients with essential tremor affecting the upper limbs who are 21 years of age or older.          Patients who are not taking medications for essential tremor or any other medical         condition for at least 2 weeks.          Patients who have not consumed alcohol or cold medications containing alcohol for at least         24 hours prior to the day of the study.          Women must not be pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing age must use birth control         while participating in this study.          Patients must not have any neurological disease other than tremor e.g., Parkinsons         disease.          Patients must not have evidence of thyroid, liver, kidney or chronic lung disease. ");

The study also provides community       information on reducing risk of stroke and recognizing the symptoms of stroke. The study       involves more than 50 participating hospitals located throughout the United States. Study       medication is provided free of charge, and a transportation stipend is available for those       in need. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Stroke is one of the important diseases that disproportionately affects African-Americans.       African-American men and women are about 2 times more likely than whites to die of       cerebrovascular disease or experience stroke. Scientific information about the efficacy and       safety of stroke preventatives in this group is much needed, yet African-Americans and other       minorities have been underrepresented in biomedical research studies. Preliminary data       collected from nonwhite, predominantly African-American patients, suggest that ticlopidine       is more effective than aspirin in the secondary prevention of stroke and death for these       patients and that the risk of serious adverse events is lower. This is a multicenter,       randomized, double-blind clinical trial of ticlopidine hydrochloride 500mg/day and aspirin       650mg/day in African-American patients with recent non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke. The       primary purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of ticlopidine and aspirin in the       prevention of the outcome endpoints recurrent stroke, vascular death, and myocardial       infarction in these African-American patients. Adverse experiences will be studied to       further our understanding of the safety of these medications in this group. The study is       being conducted at 50 sites experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke. 1800       patients are being enrolled over 3-5 years, and each will be in the study for at least 2       years. Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment at least 7 days, but no more than 90       days after cerebral infarction. The trial promises to provide much needed information about       secondary stroke prevention in African-Americans and has the support of established       African-American physician, church-based, and community organizations. Enrollment of a       substantial number of African-American women is anticipated. Data from these patients will       significantly add to our understanding of cerebrovascular disease among black women.       Furthermore, the study could also serve as an organizational framework for future studies of       stroke prevention or hyperacute treatment in the African-American population.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND:        Longitudinal studies of coronary risk factors beginning in subjects at adult age have shown       that hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity are related to the risk of coronary       artery disease and stroke. The Framingham Study has shown, in adults over 30 years of age, a       positive association between risk of cardiovascular disease and low density lipoprotein       cholesterol, elevated systolic blood pressure and diabetes, and a negative association with       high density lipoprotein cholesterol.        In 1971 when the Muscatine Heart Study was initiated, there was preliminary evidence that       these processes began in childhood. It was noted that childrens lipids, blood pressures,       and body size maintained a degree of rank order over time, suggesting that those with high       levels were likely to become adults with high levels. Whether elevated levels in children of       the accepted adult coronary risk factors were predictive of future cardiovascular disease       morbidity and mortality remained an important unanswered question.        No data were available which directly linked overt cardiovascular disease to childhood       measures of risk factors. The Muscatine study followed children from their school age years       into middle age. This study, for the first time, directly related multiple observations of       levels and profiles of change in coronary risk factors during childhood to levels of these       risk factors measured at ages when the levels had established predictive significance for       the development of premature atherosclerotic heart disease.        The Muscatine Heart Study was funded over the years by a Specialized Center of Research       SCOR in Arteriosclerosis. The SCOR program was initiated by the NHLBI to expedite the       development and application of new knowledge essential for improved diagnosis, treatment,       and prevention of arteriosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, pulmonary disease,       and thrombosis. The Muscatine Heart Study was also funded by R01HL35600.        Several substudies were conducted using the Muscatine study population. The subproject on       left ventricular mass in childhood was designed to determine the age/sex distribution of       left ventricular mass in children 5-14 years of age and whether elevated left ventricular       mass, as demonstrated by echocardiography, could be related to higher ambulatory blood       pressure, exercise blood pressure and work capacity, or physical conditioning. The study       also determined whether there was a familial aggregation of left ventricular mass, whether       it was associated with high blood pressure in parents and whether left ventricular mass in       children was associated with increased cardiovascular and all causes mortality in first and       second degree relatives.        Two subprojects were conducted on the determinants of blood pressure during childhood. Both       investigated factors related to blood pressure in groups of children whose blood pressure       patterns had been documented over a period of four to 10 years. Five groups of children were       identified for study: a group with persistently high pressure; a group with rising blood       pressure; a group with decreasing pressure; a group with persistently low pressure; and a       group with labile high blood pressure.        The first subproject studied cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, echocardiographic       dimensions, responses to exercise and to mental stress in these groups of children. The       purpose of this study was to define whether there were significant differences in blood       pressure control during rest, exercise and mental stress in these groups and to determine       whether differences in left ventricular wall mass resulted in these groups. The second       subproject studied blood pressure control mechanisms in a free-living sample of these five       groups while they consumed usual, high and low salt diets. Measurements were made of       baroreflex control, structural component of vascular resistance, and response to mental       stress. The purpose of this study was to define whether salt sensitivity existed in school       children and how it expressed itself on blood pressure control mechanisms.        Studies were also conducted on apolipoproteins in childhood to determine their role as a       risk factor and apolipoprotein A-I and A-II gene polymorphisms and their associations with       alterations in high density lipoprotein levels and risk of coronary artery disease.        DESIGN NARRATIVE:        The design was both cross-sectional and longitudinal. Between 1971 and 1986, over 13,000       school age children from 5 to 18 years of age were screened for coronary risk factors.       Measurements were made of serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, blood pressure, height,       weight, and skinfold thickness. Beginning in 1980 the graduates of the Muscatine schools who       had participated in earlier screens were recruited at ages 23, 28, 33, and 38 years to have       their risk factors re-assessed. The oldest graduates were 38 years of age by 1991. The total       number of adults was 5,126. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       No eligibility criteria ");

The cohort is       an expansion of the Jackson, Mississippi site of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities       ARIC study and is a partnership among two minority institutions Jackson State University       and Tougaloo College, one majority institution in Jackson, Mississippi the University of       Mississippi Medical Center, the National Institutes of Health NIH National Center on       Minority Health and Health Disparities NCMHD, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood       Institute NHLBI. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND:        Heart disease and stroke remain the first and third leading killers of all Americans, with a       disproportionate share of the burden borne by African Americans. Cardiovascular and total       mortality are known to be higher among African Americans than among white Americans, but       reasons for these differences remain unknown. In addition, well-documented declines in CVD       and coronary disease mortality in the past three decades have not been shared equally       between blacks and whites. Age-adjusted death rates were identical in both groups in 1980,       but by 1994 the rate among African Americans was 14% higher than in whites. The race       difference in magnitude of coronary heart disease CHD mortality is greater in women than       men and higher in middle age, such that CHD deaths tend to occur in blacks about 5 years       earlier than in whites. Excess cerebrovascular disease incidence and mortality in blacks are       even greater than the differences noted in CHD.        Cardiovascular mortality rates in Mississippi, which are approximately 25% higher than the       United States average, are the highest in the United States for all race-sex groups.       Age-adjusted CVD mortality for African American women in Mississippi was 75% higher than in       white women in 1994. The mortality for African American men was 47% higher than in white       men.        Prevalence of hypertension is nearly 40% greater in African Americans than in whites and its       sequelae are more frequent and severe. Evidence of target organ damage such as renal failure       and left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in black than white hypertensives at       comparable levels of blood pressure. Many risk factors are also more common in blacks,       including diabetes, high serum lipoprotein levels [Lpa], and obesity in women. Other       risk factors, such as elevated total cholesterol, reduced high-density lipoprotein       HDL-cholesterol, and heavy cigarette smoking, are more common in whites.        DESIGN NARRATIVE:        The Jackson Heart Study JHS initial examination, which began in the fall of 2000, included       men and women ages 35 to 84, and took 3 years to complete. The coordinating center, located       at Jackson State University, collects and analyzes data. The undergraduate training center       at Tougaloo College offers coursework to students in public health and epidemiology, and       provides practical experience in health research to prepare them for potential careers in       these fields. The exam center at the University of Mississippi is responsible for recruiting       participants and conducting examinations. JHS is uniquely positioned to answer key questions       regarding the excess burden of CVD among African Americans and to address the critical       shortage of minority investigators trained in epidemiology and prevention. These questions       will be answered by incorporating state-of-the-art physiologic and epidemiologic methods in       a stable population-based minority cohort, providing research experience, and building       research capabilities at minority institutions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND:        Each year, more than 40,000 new patients require treatment for end stage renal disease, a       condition which is 4-fold higher among African Americans than Caucasians. Trials of       angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ACEIs in Caucasians support a role of the       renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. Yet, despite the high       prevalence of nephropathy among African Americans, Blacks have been under-represented in       studies in ACEIs. Data from our laboratory suggest that the renal effects of ACEI may differ       in African Americans. African Americans are resistant to the anti-hypertensive effects of       ACEI and, thus, may be resistant to the renoprotective effects as well. The ACE deletion       allele, a variant associated with increased ACE activity and progression of renal diseases,       is increased in frequency in African Americans, while the frequency of the Ang AT1 receptor       C allele, a variant associated with antihypertensive responsiveness to ACEI is decreased.       Moreover, African Americans exhibit decreased sensitivity to Ang I and increased sensitivity       to bradykinin. Taken together, these data suggest the hypothesis that ACE activity is       increased in African Americans, leading to decreased bradykinin levels  and receptor       sensitization and increased tissue Ang II and receptor desensitization.        DESIGN NARRATIVE:        The study tests the hypothesis that ACE activity is increased in African Americans, leading       to decreased bradykinin levels and receptor sensitization and increased tissue Ang II and       receptor desensitization. The effects of race, hypertension and ACE insertion/deletion       genotype on ACE activity will be determined, as measured by the pressor and renal       vasoconstrictor responses to Ang I and Ang II and the vasodilator response to bradykinin.       Specific bradykinin and angiotensin receptor antagonists will be used to determine the       relative contribution of increased bradykinin and decreased angiotensin II to the renal       hemodynamic effects of ACEIs in African Americans and Caucasians.

Children with cerebral palsy may       have one arm that has significantly greater function good arm than the other bad arm.       Restricting the use of the good arm may improve the use of the bad arm. In pediatric CI       therapy, the good arm is put in a sling to force increased use of the bad arm. The bad arm       is also trained each day for several weeks. This study will test the ability of pediatric CI       therapy to improve motor function in children with cerebral palsy. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Cerebral palsy afflicts at least two in 1,000 children in the United States and       approximately 2,000,000 children worldwide. Behavioral techniques that impact the plasticity       of the nervous system need to be incorporated into practical, evidence-based therapeutic       interventions for this condition.        CI therapy was derived from basic research with animal and human subjects. Randomized,       controlled studies indicate that it can substantially reduce the motor deficit of adult       patients with mild to moderately severe chronic strokes and can increase their independence       over a period of years. CI therapy involves motor restriction of the less affected upper       extremity for a period of 2 to 3 weeks while concurrently training the more affected upper       limb. This gives rise to concentrated, repetitive use of the more affected extremity. In       adults, CI therapy has lead to a large increase in use-dependent cortical reorganization       involving the recruitment of substantial new regions of the brain in the innervation of more       affected extremity movement.        The study will evaluate CI therapy in a pediatric population. The study will test whether       pediatric CI therapy can promote new and improved motor behavior in young children with       hemiparesis associated with cerebral palsy. Pediatric CI therapy involves total restraint of       the unaffected upper extremity with simultaneous repetitive use of the affected extremity       for 6 hours/day for 21 consecutive days.        Fifty-two children ages 2 to 6 years old with hemiparetic cerebral palsy will be randomly       assigned to either the pediatric CI therapy group or to a control group. The control group       will receive standard rehabilitation therapy. All children will have a complete medical       evaluation with emphasis on motor function prior to treatment initiation. Children will       undergo follow-up testing at 1, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. The primary study       assessment tools are the Pediatric Developmental Motor Scales - II PDMS-II, DASI – II,       Bayley Developmental Skills Test, Pediatric Motor Activity Log PMAL, Child Arm Use Test       CAUT, and Emerging Behavior Scale EBS.

Some people with advanced CHF have difficulty       taking beta-blocker medications due to troublesome side effects, such as low blood pressure       and/or low heart rate, severe tiredness, dizziness, or shortness of breath. In other words,       they have difficulty tolerating beta-blocker medications. The purpose of this study is to       determine if enoximone can improve a patients ability to tolerate a beta-blocker       medication. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Over the last decade, it has become evident that certain beta-blocking agents       beta-blockers exert a favorable effect on the natural history of mild to moderate chronic       heart failure CHF, including reducing mortality and hospitalization rate. However, as       heart failure becomes more severe, beta-blockers become difficult to administer because of       myocardial depression leading to hemodynamic intolerance. A recent clinical study       demonstrated that subjects who could not tolerate the beta-blocker metoprolol experienced       improved tolerability when low-dose, oral enoximone was administered prior to the       introduction of metoprolol and during ongoing treatment. This study will investigate the       hypotheses that by stabilizing subjects on enoximone first, advanced CHF subjects who are       intolerant of beta-blockade will be able to 1 tolerate the effects of beta-blocker therapy,       and 2 have clinical benefit that is due to the combination of both enoximone and       extended-release metoprolol succinate ER metoprolol. Support for these hypotheses will be       sought by demonstrating that, as compared to placebo, low-dose, oral enoximone plus ER       metoprolol will increase left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF, improve symptoms of       heart failure, and improve submaximal exercise tolerance in subjects with CHF. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion criteria          In order to be considered an eligible subject, all of the following entry criteria must be         met:            -  Subjects must be competent to provide informed written consent. Subjects must sign an              IRB/IEC approved informed consent form prior to the initiation of any study              procedures.            -  Subjects must be 18 years of age or older.            -  Subjects must have ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy with symptoms of NYHA Class              III or IV chronic heart failure.            -  Subjects must have a LVEF of less than or equal to 35%, measured within 60 days of              the Screening Visit. LVEF must be assessed by radionuclide ventriculography MUGA.              If the subject has experienced any cardiovascular events, has undergone any              interventions, or received any changes in treatment that may have affected LV              function since the most recent EF measurement, an LVEF measurement must be completed              prior to the subject being randomized.            -  Subjects must have a left ventricular end diastolic dimension LVEDD of >2.7 cm/m2              as measured by 2-D ECHO within 12 months of the Screening Visit.            -  Subjects must be on optimal conventional heart failure therapy with the exception of              a beta-blocker, including an ACEI for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit,              or the subject must have had a trial of an ACEI and proven to be intolerant, or the              subject must be taking an ARB for at least 30 days prior to the Screening Visit or              proved to be intolerant. Optimal conventional therapy may also include              spironolactone, digitalis glycosides, diuretics, or other vasodilators.            -  Subjects must have failed the initiation, or the up-titration, of a beta-blocker drug              due to hemodynamic intolerance within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit. Failure              to tolerate beta-blockade for hemodynamic reasons is defined as worsening signs and              symptoms of chronic heart failure, hypotension accompanied with symptoms, or evidence              of organ hypoperfusion, which in the judgment of the treating physician precluded              further treatment with the beta-blocker. This beta-blocker intolerance must have been              documented prior to Screening, and a narrative description of the intolerance must be              approved by Myogen prior to Randomization.

Essential tremor is an involuntary       shaking, usually of the hands, for which there is no satisfactory treatment. It affects       about 1.4 percent of the general U.S. population, with the figure climbing to nearly 4       percent among people over 40. Results of two previous NIH studies have shown 1-octanol to be       promising as a potential new treatment. This study will test the effectiveness of 1-octanol       on essential tremor at doses lower than those given previously.        Patients 21 years old and older with essential tremor may be eligible for this study.       Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for two treatment periods of 1 week       each, with a 1-week break at home between treatments. Before beginning treatment,       participants undergo a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, and an       electrocardiogram EKG. In addition, tremors are measured using accelerometry, a procedure       in which a small device, mounted on a piece of cardboard, is taped to the patients hand for       about 30 minutes.        Patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group takes 2 to 4 capsules of       1-octanol 3 times a day for 1 week, followed by a 1-week washout period no treatment,       and then 2 to 4 capsules of placebo 3 times a day for 1 week. Following the same dosage       schedule, the second group takes placebo the first week, followed by the washout period and       then 1-octanol treatment. Blood pressure and pulse are measured at 15, 30, and 60 minutes       after the first dose of the day and then 3 times a day each day of hospitalization, EKG and       blood draws are done every other day during hospitalization, and blood is drawn again 1 week       after the end of the study. Patients evaluate their tremor daily according to a tremor scale       and are also rated according to an alcohol intoxication scale. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Essential tremor is a very common movement disorder affecting approximately 1.4% of the       population. Response to medications such as beta blockers and mysoline may be only partial       or be accompanied by intolerable side effects. Roughly 80% of patients have significant       tremor reduction from? ethanol although daily use of this as a treatment has potentially       serious social and legal consequences. The leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology of       essential tremor is the unmasking of spontaneous oscillation of neurons in the inferior       olive. Both ethanol and 1-octanol have been shown to reduce these spontaneous oscillations       in a animal model of essential tremor; however, 1-octanol does this at a dose much lower       than an intoxicating dose suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of essential       tremor. Two pilot studies with 1-octanol in patients with essential tremor suggested it was       both efficacious and safe.        Objectives: The aim of the present study is to further assess efficacy of 1-octanol in       essential tremor in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study.        Study population: Patients with alcohol-responsive essential tremor.        Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled two-period cross-over design.        Outcome parameters: Primary outcome parameter is tremor as assessed by accelerometry,       secondary outcome measures are spiral drawing, subjective and clinical scoring.        Estimate of the outcome: 1-octanol at the dose of 32mg/kg three times a day will       significantly improve tremor in patients with alcohol-responsive essential tremor.        Anticipated risks and benefits: Besides the unusual taste, there are no anticipated risks       associated with 1-octanol ingestion. Patients may experience an improvement of their tremor.        Potential meaning for the field: Better treatment of essential tremor. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:               14 patients with a clinical diagnosis of essential tremor will participate in the              study. Selection criterion is essential tremor with a history of ethanol              responsiveness. Informed consent will be obtained by any of the co-investigators.          Patients must be off any medications used to treat essential tremor such as mysoline or         propranolol for at least 2 weeks. Patients must withhold ethanol and caffeine 24 hours         prior to starting the treatment periods through the end of treatment periods, including         alcohol or caffeine containing over the counter medications. Ethanol and caffeine         consumption is allowed in the washout period.          EXCLUSION CRITERIA:          Patients with abnormalities on neurologic exam other than tremor.          Patients with a history of chronic alcohol dependence.          Patients with chronic medical conditions such as renal failure, hepatic failure and         chronic lung disease.          Patients on other medications that cannot be temporarily discontinued for the length of         the study.          Patients, who, for moral or religious reasons, do not wish to take a potentially         intoxicating drug.          Patients with abnormalities on their baseline screening laboratory tests.          Women who are pregnant or lactating.          Patients under the age of 21.          Asians and Pacific Islanders. ");

MCI is the earliest clinically detectable evidence for brain changes due to       Alzheimers disease AD. The second goal of this project is to describe the       inter-relationships among anatomical biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and       cognition measures in those elderly people who develop MCI. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The goal of this project is to use magnetic resonance imaging MRI and cerebrospinal fluid       CSF biomarkers to identify cognitively normal participants who show the earliest       clinically detectable brain changes of Alzheimers disease AD.        The major hypothesis for this study is that CSF P-tau231 measurement improves the accuracy       of MRI and cerebrospinal fluid CSF measurements in predicting mild cognitive impairment       MCI. Validation of this hypothesis can lead to improved diagnostic tools for detecting AD       as early as possible.        This 5-year longitudinal study will involve a baseline exam and two 18-month followup exams.       Participants will undergo MRI scans, CSF collection and blood samples, neuropsychological       performance testing, and medical, neurological and psychiatric assessment. The screening and       diagnostic evaluations will be carried out by the New York University Alzheimer Disease Core       Center ADCC and the NYU Center for Brain Health.

The       standard treatment is with thyroxine T4, and conventionally, a serum thyrotropin TSH       concentration within the laboratory range is taken as indicating adequacy of thyroxine       dosage.        Some patients with hypothyroidism complain of persistently impaired well-being, despite       taking thyroxine in a dose which normalises serum TSH concentrations. It is not clear       whether this is because of comorbidity or because standard thyroxine replacement is in some       way inadequate for some individuals.        The reference range for serum TSH is wide currently 0.34-4.8 mU/L at PathCentre. The       distribution of serum TSH concentrations in the population is skewed, with the mean and       median in the lower reference range at approximately 1.0 mU/L. This has led some to argue       that a serum TSH in the lower reference range should be the usual therapeutic target.       Anecdotal evidence suggests that some thyroxine-treated patients do feel better if the       thyroxine dose is adjusted so that serum TSH is in the lower reference range rather than the       upper reference range. The National Academy for Clinical Biochemistry of the United States       now recommends, that for thyroxine-treated patients, that serum TSH should be less than 2.0       mU/L. There is, however, no evidence from properly conducted studies that aiming for a serum       TSH concentration in the lower reference range improves symptoms of hypothyroidism or       general wellbeing, and this proposal has not been generally adopted.        Only one study examining the effects of fine titration of thyroxine dosage on wellbeing has       been published. In this study, patients had significantly improved wellbeing if they took a       dose of thyroxine which was 50 μg greater than their biochemically optimal dose as       determined by a thyrotropin-releasing hormone test. In most cases, serum TSH was suppressed       to below 0.2 mU/L the limit of sensitivity of the assay on the thyroxine doses which       improved wellbeing. This study was open-label and non-randomised, and the results therefore       may have been affected by bias.        A well-designed, double blind study of the effects of fine titration of thyroxine dosage on       symptoms of hypothyroidism, wellbeing and quality of life is required to determine if a       serum TSH in the lower reference range, rather than simply TSH within the reference range,       should indeed be the usual therapeutic target for thyroxine therapy in primary       hypothyroidism. It is also desirable to confirm the findings of Carr et al., that patients       have improved wellbeing if TSH is suppressed to below normal levels.

The doctors responsible in the respective Trial Centers will be notified to            the Ethics Committee immediately after enrolment. At present there are no enrolled            Trial Centers.          6. Ethics Committee:             The present Trial Protocol has been presented to the Ethics Committee of the Free            University of Berlin chairman: Prof. Dr. med. D. Ganten for review.          7. Other Ethics Committees:             This Trial Protocol has so far not been presented to any other institutions for            assessment.          8. Classification of the Study:             This is a Phase IV study. The study will be carried out with a licensed medicament            amlodipine with a licensed indication hypertension. This is a clinical study in            patients who are legally competent and who are capable of understanding the nature,            importance and scope of the clinical trial.          9. Legal Basis German Medicines Act        1.2 Justification and Aim of the Study:          1. Aim and Hypothesis:             The aim of the study is to show that the administration of the calcium antagonist            amlodipine significantly reduces mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure.             Hypothesis: Amlodipine reduces the mortality in patients with end-stage renal failure.          2. Current Status of Research and Basis for the Performance of the Study:             The life expectancy of patients with end-stage renal failure is nowadays still less            than 10 years. The annual mortality rate of patients with end-stage renal failure is            almost 25%. Death of patients with end-stage renal failure is frequently the            consequence of cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular events in patients with            dialysis-dependent renal failure are particularly frequently seen because the            traditional risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking,            are frequently present in this group. In addition, there are also numerous risk factors            associated with the renal failure, such as increased oxidative stress, inflammatory            vascular changes, excess salt and water load. Important cofactors for the increased            mortality in dialysis patients are an inadequate removal of the uremia toxins or a            uremia-induced malnutrition.             In patients with end-stage dialysis-dependent renal failure, increased calcification of            the coronary vessels, of the cardiac valves and other myocardial tissue, as well as an            increase in the calcium x phosphate product is frequently seen. An association is also            seen with an increased mortality. Block and colleagues were able to show that the            relative mortality risk in patients with an increased calcium x phosphate product is            increased and that increased cardiovascular causes of death could be seen. An increased            calcium x phosphate product potentiates the calcification of arterial vascular walls            and thus produces reduced elasticity. Using electron beam computer tomography it could            be shown that calcification in the region of the coronary vessels was observed much            more frequently in patients with end-stage renal failure than in healthy control            persons.             In the general population it has been shown that calcium channel blockers are very good            vasodilators and antihypertensive drugs. In the general population calcium antagonists            of the types long-acting dihydropyridines, verapamil or diltiazem are used            preferentially for the treatment of elderly patients or patients with isolated systolic            hypertension. However, patients with end-stage renal failure also profit from the            administration of calcium channel blockers, as these reduce the blood pressure, reduce            the uremia toxin-induced calcinosis of the vessels and produce a reduced influx of            calcium into the vessel walls. Calcium channel blockers inhibit macrophage            proliferation. Calcium channel blockers can also reduce raised calcium levels in            B-lymphocytes of patients with end-stage renal failure.             In a preliminary retrospective investigation, the study directors investigated the            effects of the administration of calcium antagonists on mortality. 188 patients with            end-stage renal failure and chronic regular haemodialysis were observed for 30 months            from July 1998. Parameters such as age, sex, laboratory values, clinical data and            dialysis dose were recorded. Up to December 2000 51 patients had died 27%. The            investigation showed advanced age and low body-mass index to be causes of increased            mortality. In contrast, the availability of calcium channel blockers was favorable.            After statistical analysis of the data using a Cox risk-regression model it was found            that the patients taking the calcium channel blockers showed a significantly lower            mortality relative risk 0.22 [95% confidence interval 0.17-0.67] p < 0.001. This            preliminary investigation thus shows that the use of calcium channel blockers            significantly lowers mortality in patients with end-stage dialysis-dependent renal            failure who have an increased mortality due to cardiovascular events.             2 Ethical Aspects:             Patients with end-stage renal failure and existing, or a history of known, arterial            hypertension have a clearly increased mortality because of cardiovascular events in            comparison with a normal population. So far there are no medicaments that have been            demonstrated in studies to reduce the mortality of patients with dialysis-dependent            renal failure. In a preliminary study there were indications that calcium channel            blockers, and in particular amlodipine, lead to a reduction of cardiovascular            mortality.             The investigation will be carried out after appropriate explanation has been given and            written informed consent has been obtained from the patients.             Provisions for Monitoring of the Study by the Ethics Committee:             The applicants, Prof. Dr. med. M. Tepel and Dr. med. M. van der Giet, are prepared to            enable authorized members of the Ethics Committee to observe the trial at any time.             3 Study Timetable:             3.1 Justification of the Timetable: Every patient will be observed for a period of 30            months. Patients with end-stage renal failure of non-diabetic origin have a five-year            survival expectation of about 35 - 40%, whereas patients with end-stage renal failure            of diabetic origin have a five-year survival rate of about 20% United States Renal            Data System: Annual Data Report 2000. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 2000; 36 Suppl. 2, p. 127. It            is therefore to be assumed that within 30 months about 35 - 40% of the examined            patients will die. This period should be sufficient to observe any possible positive            effects of amlodipine on mortality.             The medicinal preparation is licensed for long-term therapy, so that negative effects            due to the medicament are not to be expected.             4. General Planning:             A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with two groups will            be carried out in order to show reduction of the mortality in patients with end-stage            renal failure. The study will be carried out over a period of 30 months. A check will            be made every six months to see if an event has occurred.             All patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria and who are prepared to participate in            the study will be randomly assigned at the first issue of the study medicament to one            of the groups. The patient will receive either amlodipine 10 mg or placebo. Both            medicaments will be given as a single daily dose in the form of tablets in the morning.            The study medication will not be changed during the course of the study, insofar as no            side-effects are observed. Patients who are already taking a calcium channel blocker,            and in whom a withdrawal phase is possible according to the opinion of their physician,            will first undergo a wash-out phase of 4 weeks before starting with the double-blind            treatment. During the study, the administration of all other necessary medicaments for            the patient, apart from the administration of calcium channel blockers, is permitted. A            check will be carried out at intervals of 6 months to see whether an event has            occurred. Each patient will be observed for a period of 30 months.             4.2 Course of the Study:             Visit 1 initial examination: First of all the patient will be informed about the            study. If the patient consents to participate, a short clinical history and physical            examination will be carried out. Then the criteria of inclusion and exclusion will be            checked. The blood pressure, pulse rate and body mass index will be determined.            Subsequently the patient will be asked about previous diseases, with specific            questioning about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke            including transitory ischaemic attacks [TIA] and prolonged reversible ischaemic            neurological deficit [PRIND] and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The patient            will be enrolled in the study if he/she fulfils the inclusion criteria and there are no            exclusion criteria. Should the patient be taking a calcium channel blocker at the time            of enrolment in the study, this will be withdrawn insofar as the attending physician            considers that this is possible. Other existing medication will be retained. The            interval between Visit 1 and Visit 2 is one week.             Visit 2 start of study, month 0: The patients current medication will be recorded            with particular reference to the following concomitant medication: ACE inhibitors,            AngII blockers, statins, erythropoietin, beta-blockers. Questions will be asked about            newly developed diseases with special attention to the occurrence of diabetes mellitus,            coronary heart disease, stroke including transitory ischaemic attacks [TIA] and            prolonged reversible ischaemic neurological deficit [PRIND] and peripheral arterial            occlusive disease. The blood pressure, pulse rate and body mass index will be recorded.            Study medication for 28 weeks will be issued. The patient will be informed about taking            the medicament. Laboratory values will be recorded in the course of the routine            monitoring of the patients abbreviated and extensive routine laboratory examinations:            hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, calcium, calcium x phosphate product,            urea, serum creatinine, total protein, parathyroid hormone, cholesterol, triglycerides            and ferritin. The patient will be asked about current symptoms.             Visits 3 - 6 follow-up observation, months 6, 12, 18 and 24: The current medication            of the patient will be recorded with especial emphasis on the following concomitant            medications: ACE inhibitors, AngII blockers, statins, erythropoietin, beta-blockers.            Questions will be asked about newly developed diseases with special attention to the            occurrence of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke including transitory            ischaemic attacks [TIA] and prolonged reversible ischaemic neurological deficits            [PRIND] and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The blood pressure, pulse rate and            body mass index will be recorded. The study medication will be counted. New supplies of            study medication for 28 weeks will be issued. Questions will be asked about            side-effects. The patient will be asked about current symptoms. Laboratory values will            be recorded in the course of the routine monitoring of the patient abbreviated routine            laboratory: hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, calcium, calcium x phosphate            product, urea, serum creatinine, total protein.             Visit 7 study closure, month 30: The current medication of the patient will be            recorded with especial emphasis on the following concomitant medications: ACE            inhibitors, AngII blockers, statins, erythropoietin, beta-blockers. Questions will be            asked about newly developed diseases with special attention to the occurrence of            diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, stroke including transitory ischaemic            attacks [TIA] and prolonged reversible ischaemic neurological deficits [PRIND] and            peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The blood pressure, pulse rate and body mass            index will be recorded. The study medication will be counted. Questions will be asked            about side-effects.

Exception: the administration of a            calcium channel blocker during the study is not permissible. The medication will be            recorded in detail at the regular monitoring visits.             5. Objectives:             5.1 Primary Parameters: The primary parameter will be the survival rate.             5.2 Secondary Parameters: No secondary parameters will be investigated during the            study.             5.3 Methods for Recording Efficacy and Safety:             All patients will be encouraged to maintain their diet and regular physical exercise            throughout the duration of the study.             All patients will be followed up at intervals of 6 months. At these visits,            side-effects and changes in vital status will be recorded.             When the medicament is issued for the first time, all patients will be observed for 2            hours after taking it.             5.4 Compliance: The study medication and the concomitant medicaments will be checked at            6 month intervals. If necessary, the patients will be reminded of the necessity to take            the drug.             6. Data Management: All data for the study will be entered in the Clinical Record Forms            and submitted for central analysis of the data study directors. One copy of the            Clinical Record Form will be retained by the attending physician. The study directors            will ensure that the data are analyzed and statistically evaluated. Current Data            Protection Regulations will be observed. The data will be analyzed in an anonymised            form. The patient must consent to the data being recorded in the context of the            clinical trial, being analyzed and being submitted at the request of the pertinent            supervisory authorities. Each patient will be assigned a number on enrolment in the            study and his /her initials will be recorded. Unequivocal patient identification will            be possible via a patient identification list consisting of the patient number,            initials, date of birth, name and first name. All data will be archived for a period of            10 years.             6.1 Statistical Procedures:             This 30-month-long, double-blind, placebo-control study is intended to show that the            administration of calcium antagonists reduces the mortality of patients undergoing            regular haemodialysis.             The hypotheses to be tested are:             H0: the mortality rates are the same; HA: the mortality rates are different.             The log-rank test will be used to test for possible statistically significant            differences probability p = 0.05, two-tailed test.             It is not intended to carry out any interim analysis.             6.2 Estimation of Number of Cases:             The sample size is calculated by comparison of two survival curves Computer-Programm:            n-Query: Log-rank-Test of survival in two groups.             The size of the sample is calculated on the basis of alpha = 0.05, power 80%,            two-tailed test for a difference of 14% between amlodipine and placebo with a sample            size of 163 per group log-rank test or survival in two groups, followed for fixed            time, constant hazard ratio. Expected mortality rate: placebo 40% and amlodipine 26% .             It is assumed that 30 patients will drop out of the study from the two groups together            e.g. change of dialysis center.             Therefore, 356 patients 178 patients amlodipine versus 178 patients placebo are to be            investigated.             7.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Hypertension is one of the major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. It is also       important for elderly hypertensive patients to strictly reduce their blood pressures to       prevent cardiovascular events. Although angiotensin II receptor blockers ARBs are       increasingly used in antihypertensive treatment recently, few studies have been performed in       Japan to assess the difference between high-dose ARB monotherapy and combination therapy of       ARB with calcium channel blocker CCB in prevention of cardiovascular diseases for patients       whose blood pressure is not well controlled by ARB monotherapy. OSCAR-study is a       multicenter, active-controlled, 2-arm parallel group comparison, prospective randomized open       blinded end-point PROBE design study. The dose administered is olmesartan medoxomil       20mg/day as ARB monotherapy in the Step 1 period. If the blood pressure is not adequately       controlled and treatment is well tolerated then the dose is changed to olmesartan medoxomil       40mg/day in the high-dose ARB monotherapy group, or olmesartan medoxomil 20mg/day and a CCB       in the combination therapy group in the Step 2 period. At least 500 patients will be       enrolled in each group, and the follow-up duration will be 3 years.

We hypothesise that a BNP test performed in real-time in patients presenting to the       Emergency Department with shortness of breath will help identify additional patients with       CHF and consequently to change practice and allow more patients to recieve correct treatment       earlier. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       In recent years new tests to diagnose heart failure have become available. We are evaluating       a new test called B-type natriuretic peptideBNPin patients presenting to the Emergency       Department with shortness of breath. Patients are randomised into whether they will receive       the new test or not. In the patient group where the test is positive, standardised approach       that will optimise heart failure treatment will be introduced. We hypothesise that with this       approach we will improve the clinical care of patients who present to the Emergency       Department with shortness of breath. Measures of outcomes will be the accuracy of diagnosis       2 hours after presentation, 30 day mortality, hospital and ICU admission rates and quality       of life at 30days.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00166231","TITLE:       Understanding Pediatric Chest Pain and Other Symptoms SUMMARY:       The causes of pediatric pain are often not the same for every child. Most children who visit       a cardiology specialist with complaints of chest or other somatic pain have no known medical       diagnosis to explain their symptoms. These children and their families often leave with no       explanation for the childs distress.        This early study will ask parents and children specific questions related to the stress in       their lives, their emotional well-being and the childrens physical functioning. The       investigators want children who experience chest and other somatic pain, and those who do       not, to be in their study so that they can look at both groups.        The investigators hope to use these answers to better inform cardiologists who often work       with children with non-cardiac pain and, in turn, help them to better serve their patients.       Ultimately, the investigators hope that the answers they get will provide answers to these       families. They also hope to use the results of this study to put together a short screener       for the cardiologist to give to pediatric patients with complaints of chest or other somatic       pain to help the cardiologists better understand their patients symptoms. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The current investigation will address some similar factors considered in prior research,       but will considerably extend our understanding of how psychological, familial, and       environmental factors influence noncardiac chest pain. In this investigation, a number of       variables that have not been considered in prior research in this area will be included.       Among these child variables are: the childrens pain coping strategies, the childrens       somatization behaviors aside from chest pain, the childrens externalizing symptoms e.g.,       symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, school related problems, social       competencies, parental perceptions of the childs vulnerability, functional disability the       degree to which chest pain interferes with normal daily functioning, and the childs health       care utilization. Also, a more sensitive quantification of the childrens frequency and       intensity of chest pain will be collected, as well as information on situations in which the       pain occurs. Parent report of child functioning and child self-report will be used to assess       childrens behavior. The parental factors to be assessed include the parents own physical       conditions and health care utilization, as well as the parents psychological functioning.       The amount of changes and stress the family as a whole has experienced in different domains       will also be assessed as well. Measures of these constructs, as well as childrens anxiety       and depression similar to Lipsitz et al. reviewed above will be collected at the time of       the original appointment.        With the exception of the chest pain measure, quantification of these variables will be       collected for both chest pain and innocent murmur patients between the ages of 8 and 18       years of age at the time of their initial appointment. Further, approximately one month       following the medical assessment by the cardiologists, the parents and children will be       asked to complete a measure of their satisfaction with the medical care they were provided,       their health care utilization subsequent to the diagnostic cardiology appointment, their       various somatic symptoms, and their functional disability at the one month follow-up       assessment. Also, the chest pain patients will be asked to complete the chest pain inventory       in conjunction with their parent.        Between-group analyses will address how these multiple variables differ for the chest pain       group and patients presenting for an evaluation for heart murmurs. This will be true at both       the time of the patients appointment and at follow-up. Further, within-group correlational       analyses will be conducted primarily for with the chest pain group. The goal of these within       group analyses will be to address how the various child, parent, and familial factors       correlate with the childrens chest pain symptoms, healthcare utilization, other somatic       symptoms, and functional disability. In addition, for the chest pain group, the patients       and their families functioning at the time of the initial appointment will be used to       predict chest pain and other somatic symptom maintenance, health care utilization following       the initial appointment, and satisfaction with their medical care at follow-up. Each of       these questions will advance the literature in this area.        We should also point out why the innocent murmur group was chosen as a comparison sample for       the chest pain patients. As noted above, pain is a subjective experience that is first noted       by the patient and then communicated to others. It is then reacted to in various ways by       those in the childs environment. In contrast, a child with a heart murmur is not the one       who first notices the symptom and then communicates it. Instead, the patient with a murmur       is told that they have the symptom by a pediatrician, family practice physician, or other       health care provider. This tendency to notice and interpret pain in a particular manner is       an essential component in the history of the children and their families who report to       cardiology clinics for an evaluation of the etiology of chest pain. Such noticing and       interpretation is fundamentally a psychological process.        Comparison: adolescents who present in a cardiac specialty clinic with noncardiac chest pain       versus those who present with innocent murmurs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       1 Gestational trophoblastic disease GTD consists of a spectrum of disorders that are       characterized by an abnormal proliferation of trophoblastic tissue. They include       hydatidiform mole, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma and placental site trophoblastic tumor       PSTT. The incidence of molar pregnancies in Asian countries is 7 to 10 times greater than       the reported incidence in Europe or North America. Although previously a lethal disease, GTD       is considered today the most curable gynecologic cancer. This progress can be attributed to       an available tumor markerhuman chorionic gonadotropin hCG, chemosensitivity, and the       incorporation of aggressive multimodality therapy. However, a delay in the diagnosis may       increase the patients risk of developing malignant GTN and adversely affect response to       treatment, and therefore the prompt identification of GTN is important. Approximately 20% of       patients will develop malignant sequelae requiring administration of chemotherapy after       evacuation of hydatidiform moles. The overall cure rate for patients with nonmetastatic       disease and low-risk metastatic disease is nearly 100% .When chemotherapy is given for an       additional 1-2 cycles after the first normal hCG value, recurrence rates are less than 5%.       In contrast, in high risk metastatic disease, chemotherapy is continued until hCG values       have normalized, followed by at least two or three courses of maintenance chemotherapy in       the hopes of eradicating all viable tumors. Despite the use of sensitive hCG assays and       maintenance chemotherapy, up to 13% of patients with high-risk disease will develop       recurrence after achieving an initial remission. Conventionally, serial quantitative serum       hCG determinations should be performed using commercially available assays capable of       detecting β-hCG to baseline values<5 mIU/ml. However, the amount of hCG produced       correlates with tumor volume so that a serum hCG of 5 mIU/mL corresponds to approximately       104 to 105 viable tumor cells. Therefore, detection of minimal amount of human chorionic       gonadotropin <5 mIU/ml is crucial, it could help to early detect the GTD and strictly       monitor the residual activity of the tumor after chemotherapy.        Dual Polarisation Interferometry DPI is an analytical technique used to understand the       real-time structure and behaviour of a wide range of molecular systems and interactions       through quantitative measurement including molecular size, density and mass. DPI has been       successful across a range of applications, including proteins,lipids, nucleic acids,       lectins, surfactants, polymers, interfacial studies, surface characterisation and       nanotechnology.        Herein, we are trying to use the novel analytical technique -Dual Polarisation       Interferometry DPI,to achieve detection the minimal amount of the human chorionic       gonadotropin for early detection and strict monitor of the GTD. Under this circumstance,       maintenance chemotherapy is continued until hCG values is totally undetectable, in the hopes       of eradicating all viable tumors. Besides this method could be more precise in sensitivity       and specificity to avoid the false positive result which could led to unnecessary       chemotherapy or surgery.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Delirium is confusion or a sudden change in alertness which may happen after hip repair       surgery. Up to 65% of elderly undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture experience       post-operative delirium. These individuals often stay in the hospital longer, have more       complications, and are more likely to die.

SUMMARY:       It has been suggested that cognitive functioning is impaired in chronic pain patients. Since       most of these pain patients engage in daily activities including driving, it was       hypothezised that they may have an increased risk of becoming involved in traffic accidents. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Most chronic pain patients engage in daily activities including driving. Driving a car is a       complex task requiring mental alertness and a variety of cognitive functions such as       perception, attention, learning, memory and decision making.Several studies have       demonstrated cognitive impairments on laboratory tasks in patients with chronic pain,       particularly on measures assessing attentional capacity, processing speed and psychomotor       speed. These findings suggest that car driving performance might be impaired, and that       chronic pain patients may therefore have an increased traffic accident risk. Unfortunately,       no studies have investigated the impact of chronic pain on actual driving ability. The       present study was designed to investigate the effects of chronic pain on actual driving       performance during normal traffic. In addition to the on-the-road driving test, psychomotor,       and memory tests measuring driving-related skills were conducted in the laboratory.       Moreover, effects of pain on an attentional capacity test were tested using event-related       potentials.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00194259","TITLE:       Sleep Apnea in Look AHEAD Action for Health in Diabetes SUMMARY:       This study will assess the effects of weight loss on sleep-disordered breathing SDB in 120       obese, type 2 diabetics with obstructive sleep apnea OSA from four Look AHEAD sites.       Changes in SDB will be compared between subjects randomized to weight loss Lifestyle       Intervention Group versus non-weight loss Diabetes Education and Support Group conditions       within the context of the Look AHEAD Study. Weight loss is frequently recommended for obese       patients with OSA, but the empirical foundation for this recommendation is not well       substantiated. Weight loss in obese apneics improves but does not eliminate SDB. Moreover,       the degree of improvement is not correlated with the amount of weight loss. This study will       assess SDB before treatment and at 1 and 2 years. We will also investigate clinical measures       of fat distribution that may mediate the non-linear relationship between weight loss and       improvements in SDB. Finally, we will examine the role of SDB in mediating changes in blood       pressure associated with weight loss. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The duration of the study is 5 years; participants will be enrolled in the study for a total       of 2 years. Recruitment will be based on the protocol set forth in the larger Look AHEAD       trial that will occur in 8 treatment waves, spaced approximately 4 months apart. Each of       these waves at the Penn site will include 40 people, making the potential subject pool       approximately 320 persons.        Participants at the Penn site will be approximately 44 men and women, between 45 and 75       years of age, with a body mass index BMI > 25 kg/m2. All subjects will be obese type 2       diabetics who have been randomly assigned to the Lifestyle Intervention Group or the       Diabetes Education and Support Group in the Look AHEAD Study. Therefore, the inclusion and       exclusion criteria are determined by the parent study. Patients who are currently being       treated for OSA e.g., continuous positive airway pressure or who have had surgical       treatment for OSA will be excluded. Patients who have been previously diagnosed with OSA but       are not being treated will be included. These 44 individuals represent a subset of the       approximately 320 persons who will be treated at the University of Pennsylvania site.        As part of the baseline visit before randomization for the Look AHEAD study, Look AHEAD       participants will be asked to sign a consent form for screening. Consenting participants       will complete the Multivariate Apnea Prediction Form. The MAP includes weight, height, age       and 3 questions about sleep-related symptoms. After the prescreen consent has been       completed, the Research Coordinator will invite the participant to complete the consent form       for this study. Interested subjects will be scheduled to meet with this studys Research       Coordinator during the subjects next scheduled Look AHEAD visit. Participants wishing to       enroll will undergo the baseline assessments and be scheduled for their baseline sleep       study. Subjects will be paid $50 for this sleep assessment. After completion of the baseline       sleep study, the results will be analyzed. Thirty subjects with a baseline RDI > 15 and 28       subjects with an RDI between 5 and 15 5 < RDI < 15 will continue in the study, undergoing       the same assessments at years 1 and 2.        Obstructive sleep apnea OSA is a syndrome characterized by frequent cessations of airflow       during sleep despite continued respiratory effort that are caused by the closure of the       pharyngeal airway. The most frequently used metric to describe OSA is the respiratory       disturbance index RDI sometimes referred to as the apnea-hypopnea index or AHI. RDI is       defined as the average number of apnea/hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The medical       consequences of OSA include an increased risk of hypertension, stroke, myocardial       infarction, and premature mortality. The behavioral and psychosocial consequences of OSA       include excessive daytime sleepiness, depression, sexual dysfunction, and a 3-7 fold       increase in the risk of motor vehicle accidents. Among 30 to 60 year olds, 9% of women and       24% of men in the general population have an RDI > 5. The serious consequences and high       prevalence of OSA clearly constitute a major public health problem.        OSA is strongly related to obesity, an important public health problem in its own right. In       a series of 1000 OSA patients, two thirds had body weights > 30% above recommended. Several       studies have identified body mass index BMI as the strongest predictor of RDI. Data from       the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study revealed that a one standard deviation increase in BMI was       associated with a four-fold increase in the risk of having an RDI > 5. Among obese patients       seeking weight loss treatment, nearly 40% exhibited evidence of SDB, and 10% required       treatment for OSA. The link between obesity and SDB is further supported by data showing       that weight loss significantly improves SDB in obese patients with OSA. Perhaps the most       compelling data about the effects of weight change on SDB, particularly weight gain, come       from a very recent study of the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort that examined changes in weight and       SDB over 4 years in a community sample of 690. On average, the sample experienced a 3 kg       weight gain and 1.4/hr increase in RDI. Across the entire sample, on average, a 1% change in       body weight was associated with a 3% change in RDI. Participants who reduced body weight by       10% experienced a 26% reduction in RDI, while those who increased body weight by 10%       experienced a 32% increase in RDI. A 10% weight gain was associated with a 6-fold increase       in the risk of developing a RDI > 15. These descriptive, longitudinal data are suggestive of       the benefits of weight loss on SDB, but several factors limit conclusions about the effects       of weight loss on obese OSA patients. First, the initial mean RDI was 4.1, so very few       subjects n = 46 had moderate or severe OSA RDI > 15. Further, only a small number of       subjects n = 61 lost > 5% of initial body weight. Finally, similar to the broader       literature on the effects of weight loss, this study is limited by the lack of a no-weight       loss control group and the inability to distinguish intentional from non-intentional weight       loss.        Weight loss is a frequently recommended treatment for obese patients with OSA, but the data       to support this recommendation are not available. The lack of randomized trials, the study       of predominantly male samples, and the absence of follow-up evaluations leave physicians and       patients unsure about the clinical utility of weight loss for obese OSA patients. This study       will assess the effects of weight loss on sleep-disordered breathing SDB in obese, type 2       diabetics with OSA RDI > 15 who will be randomly assigned to the Lifestyle Intervention       Group or the Diabetes Education and Support Group conditions as part of the larger Look       AHEAD trial. Our assessment of patients at baseline, and 1 and 2 years will allow us to       examine the relationship between weight change and SDB over time. We will also examine the       role of neck and abdominal fat distribution in mediating the effects of weight loss on SDB.       Finally, we will assess the impact of SDB in mediating changes in blood pressure associated       with weight loss.        All subjects will be obese type 2 diabetics who are enrolled in the larger Look AHEAD Study.       Fifty-eight subjects in total will be needed. Thirty of these subjects will have an RDI > 15       and 28 subjects will have an RDI of 5-14.9 and all will have been randomized to either the       Lifestyle Intervention Group or the Diabetes Education and Support Group.        All participants will complete the following assessments:        Nocturnal polysomnography PSG. Overnight, unattended PSGs will be recorded in       participants homes using the Compumedics PS2 portable sleep system. Two sleep technicians       will go to the participants home at 8:00-9:00 PM on the night of the PSG. A series of       calibrations will be performed and signal quality and sensor positions will be adjusted as       necessary. Before the technicians depart, the device will be set to activate 60 minutes       prior to the subjects intended bedtime. The subject will then be asked to sit quietly and       read or watch television for the duration of the time until lights out at his/her regular       bedtime. The next morning, the 2 sleep technicians will return to the participants home to       remove the electrodes and sensors and to retrieve the equipment.        Neck circumference. Neck fat distribution will be estimated by a measurement of the neck       circumference at baseline and at 1 and 2 years by this studys Research Coordinator at the       Look AHEAD annual clinic visit. All measurements will be performed twice and recorded to the       nearest 0.1 cm.        Blood pressure. Blood pressure will be assessed at baseline and at years 1 and 2 in the       participants home by the sleep technician. Measurements will be taken at night before the       equipment is attached and in the morning after the equipment has been detached. Since the       PSG is anchored to the participants usual sleep and wake schedule, we will obtain a morning       and evening blood pressure at approximately the same times of day. Blood pressure will be       measured in the dominant arm after 5 minutes of quiet rest in a seated position. Two       measurements, separated by 1 minute, will be performed and averaged.        Sagittal diameter. Sagittal diameter will be measured by the Holtain-Kahn Abdominal Caliper       at baseline and at 1 and 2 years by the Research Coordinator at the Look AHEAD annual clinic       visit. The measurement will be performed twice and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm.        Questionnaires. Daytime sleepiness will be assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ESS.       The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire measuring the general level of daytime       sleepiness. The ESS significantly distinguishes patients with and without OSA; a score above       10 is considered indicative of pathological sleepiness. Furthermore, it has been shown to       decrease for OSA patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP. Quality       of life specific to sleep apnea will be assessed by the Functional Outcomes of Sleep       Questionnaire FOSQ. The FOSQ is a measure assessing the impact of disorders of excessive       sleepiness on functional outcomes relevant to daily behaviors and quality of life. The FOSQ       reliably distinguishes apneics and controls and is sensitive to treatment effects. These       measures will be assessed at baseline and at 1 and 2 years by this studys Research       Coordinator at the Look AHEAD clinic visits and should take approximately 10 minutes to       complete.        Upper airway assessment. A brief < 10 minutes standardized clinical assessment of upper       airway and craniofacial features that distinguishes apneics and non-apneics will be       performed at baseline and at years 1 and 2 by the Research Coordinator.        Sleep log. Participants will be given a sleep log to keep for 7 days prior to their in-home       sleep study. Each morning when they wake up and each evening before going to bed they will       answer a few questions concerning the quality of their sleep and their daytime activities.        The procedures and treatments proposed in this study pose few known risks to subjects       physical and psychological well-being. The requirements imposed upon participants for this       ancillary study pose no additional risks than those already present in the larger Look AHEAD       trial. There are no invasive measures associated with this study.        The benefits to the subjects studied in this research protocol, and to society at large, far       surpass the risks. Our study will provide valuable sleep assessments to a population at high       risk for sleep apnea, a significant benefit since most cases of SDB in the United States       90% are undetected. Furthermore, our study will offer both patients and their physicians       valuable information necessary in making subsequent decisions regarding the clinical       management of any SDB. The requirements imposed upon participants for this ancillary study       pose no additional risks than those already present in the larger Look AHEAD trial.        Although weight loss is a frequently recommended treatment for obese patients with OSA,       there has only been one randomized controlled trial including a no weight loss group.       Therefore, findings from this study will provide important information to society at large       in determining the effectiveness of weight loss treatment for OSA, a serious health problem.

The trigeminal system in particular offers unique advantages for studying such alterations,       including a large central representation and high degree of somatotopy. The administration       of lamotrigine to neuropathic pain patients in conjunction with fMRI will allow us to       compare subjective ratings of pain with objective measures of neural activity during       increased conditions of allodynia/hyperalgesia.

Moreover, while the rates of osteoporosis among Canadians are stabilizing, worldwide       the number of people afflicted with osteoporosis continues to rise. The most serious       complication of osteoporosis is a broken bone or fracture. Fractures due to osteoporosis can       result in long hospital stays, dependence on others, and premature death. While there are       several medications that prevent osteoporosis they all have side effects. For example,       postmenopausal women who take hormone replacement therapy HRT are at increased risk of       breast cancer and heart disease. In addition, drugs to prevent osteoporosis are expensive       and not available worldwide. Therefore, it is essential that researchers continue to       identify and test new medications for the prevention of osteoporosis.        The purpose of the research is to determine if nitrates, a group of drugs that are widely       available, inexpensive, and commonly used to treat chest pain or angina, can prevent       osteoporosis in women. If the researchers find that nitrates prevent osteoporosis, a widely       available, inexpensive treatment for osteoporosis prevention that does not have any long       term side effects would have been identified. This will improve the health of patients with       osteoporosis worldwide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This proposal consists of two studies. The objective of the first study is to determine       which of isosorbide mononitrate ISMO at 20 mg/day or nitroglycerin ointment NTG at 15       mg/day results in fewer headaches. The nitrate that is best tolerated will be used in a       second study with one main objective: To determine if postmenopausal women with a T-score at       the lumbar spine L1 to L4 between 0 and -2.0 randomized to two years of treatment with       intermittent nitrates have a greater increase in spine BMD as compared to women randomized       to placebo.        We hypothesize that:          1. Women will report fewer headaches when they are randomized to intermittent NTG ointment            at 15 mg/day compared to intermittent oral ISMO at 20 mg/day.          2. After two years, women randomized to intermittent nitrates will have a greater percent            increase in lumbar spine BMD compared with women randomized to placebo.        To test these hypotheses we will execute 2 trials both of which include postmenopausal       women, aged 50 and older, with BMD T scores at the lumbar spine between 0 and -2.0. We will       exclude subjects with prior osteoporotic fractures or OP by BMD testing, subjects with       current metabolic bone or cardiovascular disease, subjects taking treatments for OP,       subjects with migraine headaches, and subjects with known hypersensitivity to nitrates. We       will use computer generated randomization to allocate subjects to treatment assignments. To       avoid bias the studies will be double-blind. The first study, which uses a crossover design,       will recruit 22 subjects who will be randomly assigned to each of NTG ointment and ISMO for       one week. In between treatments there will be a two week wash out period. Subjects will rate       headaches on a daily basis using a visual analog scale and for each subject I will calculate       the mean headache score over the 7 day treatment period for both treatments. We will then       calculate the mean headache score considering all subjects for NTG and the mean headache       score for ISMO. We will compare the mean headache scores for both treatments and the nitrate       preparation that is best tolerated lowest mean score will be used in a second placebo       controlled study the main study whose primary objective is to assess the effects of       intermittent nitrates on spine BMD L1 to L4 in 280 postmenopausal women. To limit       differential drop out due to headaches among subjects randomized to nitrates, the main trial       will follow a run-in phase during which all subjects will receive nitrates for one week.       Only those subjects who do not have headaches resulting in discontinuation of the study       medication during the nitrate run-in phase will enter the main study.

The prevalence of adult obesity has doubled over the past       30 years and continues to increase. In addition, industrial societies attach an economic       value to maximizing the waking period to the longest tolerable limit by sleeping as little       as possible. Average sleep time has decreased over the last century by 2 hours. Chronically       sleeping less has been associated with increased weight, endocrine and metabolic health       risks including glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. The possibility       that the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic health risks may be partially related to       insufficient sleep is now being recognized. The objective of this proof-of-concept       controlled trial is to investigate the impact of increasing sleep time in chronically       sleep-deprived, obese subjects.        STUDY POPULATION: 18-50 year old, obese BMI 30-50 men and premenopausal women, chronically       sleep deprived, recruited from the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Chronic sleep       deprivation will be verified by the use of sleep logs and the use of actigraphy before entry       into the study.

The study was terminated early for reasons of apparent futility of continuing accrual of       participants according to the original study plan. The decision was based on independent       analysis of data acquired during the initial feasibility phase and from interim analysis of       early results that failed to document objectively the achievement of substantive and       meaningful differences between experimental and control groups with respect to amounts of       sleep extension, changes in metabolic parameters, or changes in weight.

Older 4 clinical trials approved the efficacy of the daily dose of 200micg.       Its believed that Se saturates the deficient stores of GPX so GPX saves the thyrocytes       against to oxidative stresses. Although less than 70 micg/d is sufficient to maximize GPX       activity, none of the authors tested the doses less than 200 micg/d. Our hypothesis was that       If 100 micg/d can not suppress the TPOAb titers,it means autoimmune destruction can not be       blocked by saturation of deficient stores of GPX solely and the mechanism of action requires       more than repletion of deficient stores. Its important not only to estimate the optimal       dose but to understand the mechanism of action. High dose therapy may also suppress TPOAb       levels in Se-non-deficient AIT patients, if it is so, Se therapy may becomes the solely       treatment modality which can suppress the autoimmunity in more than 400 million AIT       patients. Because thereve been no way to suppress autoimmune war and replacement of LT4 had       been the only treatment modality for palliation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Despite the high prevalence of LBP and the associated economic costs, disability, and lost       productivity, and despite the development of several treatment guidelines, one of which       recommends chiropractic spinal manipulation for some subgroups of patients with back pain,       the management of LBP remains controversial and highly variable across professions and       geographic regions. Although one recent publication describes the design of chiropractic and       exercise for seniors with low back or neck pain, no published studies, to our knowledge,       have assessed the effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation compared to medical care for       older adults with sub-acute or chronic low back pain.

An important goal of       this study is the acquisition of melanocytes from lager congential melanocytic nevi LCMN       and acquired melanocytic nevi AMN for analysis, culture and experimental manipulation. We       do not propose to acquire melanocytes from pigmented lesions suspected to represent primary       melanoma because of the importance of preserving all lesional tissue required to render       accurate histopathological diagnosis. However, another aim of the study is the development       of enhanced clinical criteria for the diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma, particularly       using digital epiluminescent skin microscopy, or dermoscopy, for pigmented lesion image       acquisition and analysis. The close comparison of dermoscopic images of pigmented skin       lesions suspicious for melanoma with lesional histopathology should be useful for expanding       the knowledge base about how dermoscopy , a relatively new technique used to evaluate       pigmented skin lesions, can be used to diagnose a pigmented skin lesion as benign or       malignant. These detailed comparisons may also provide information about how specific visual       features within the dermoscopic image field correlate with histologic features of the       lesion. This information may be useful for future possible studies designed to predict       accurately which portions of a primary malignant melanoma can be removed for esperimental       study while retaining sufficient lesional information to guide further treatment and render       an accurate prognosis.        The study population will consist of three categories of patients: 1 infants and children       with large congenital melanocytic nevi, 2 adults with numerous less than 100 melanocytic       nevi, and 3 patients with primary malignant melanoma. Establishment of the Pigmented       Lesion Clinic required for the execution of this protocol will provide a mechanism for the       evaluation of patients with numerous or unusual pigmented lesions, and for the entry of       eligible patients into ongoing therapeutic trials for malignant melanoma. As the study       progresses, it is anticipated that a substantial amount of formalin-fixed nevus and primary       melanoma tissue with a high-degree of clinical annotation will be collected. As a secondary       objective , the availability of this collection will be useful to support studies designed       to evaluate new markers and techniques for the diagnosis of melanoma and atypical nevi, and       for incorporation into a tissue microarray that will be available to the melanoma research       community for target foundation validation.        Background:        The molecular events resulting in melanocyte transformation and the development of early       melanoma are incompletely understood. Risk factors for the development of melanoma include       genetic, phenotypic and environmental risk factors and can overlap. Also, persons with large       numbers of nevi face a higher risk of melanoma. These risk associations, combined with       knowledge obtained from basic studies on the survival, differentiation, and proliferation of       the melanocyte, can provide hints about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the       development of nevi and melanoma.        In this study we plan to acquire lesional tissue from pigmented lesions and develop enhanced       clinical criteria for the diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma, particularly using       digital epiluminescent skin microscopy, or dermoscopy, for pigmented lesion image       acquisition and analysis. This information may be useful for future possible studies       designed to predict accurately which portions of a primary malignant melanoma can be removed       for experimental study while retaining sufficient lesional information to guide further       treatment and render an accurate prognosis.

The primary purposes are to validate various       scintigraphic methods with pulmonary angiography as the standard of reference purpose A.       Furthermore, this project examines the relative contributions of 1 vascular obstruction, 2       vasoactive mediators, and 3 co-morbidity to the generation of right heart strain purpose       B.        BACKGROUND FOR PURPOSE A Acute pulmonary embolism is a life threatening condition. Early       intervention can be lifesaving but treatment is associated with severe side effects. Thus,       establishing accurate diagnosis is necessary. Clinical presentation and physical examination       have proven insufficient for this purpose. This is also true for basic diagnostic       investigations, e.g. electrocardiography, arterial blood gas analysis and chest x-ray, which       are considered standard tests in patients with symptoms consistent with cardiopulmonary       disease.        For several decades lung scintigraphy has been considered a cornerstone in the diagnosis of       acute pulmonary embolism. Planar two-dimensional images of the pulmonary perfusion are       obtained using a gamma camera after intravenous injection of radiolabelled microparticles,       depicting perfusion defects caused by e.g. a pulmonary embolus. Similarly, ventilatory       function can be assessed two-dimensionally by planar scintigraphic imaging following       inhalation of a radioactive gas or aerosol. Lung scintigraphy has certain limitations,       primarily related to image interpretation. The PIOPED criteria, based on the combined       ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy, have gained global acceptance, but are often       inconclusive and give rise to misunderstandings. A different set of interpretation criteria,       provided by the PISA-PED study group, are based solely on perfusion imaging. Opposite the       PIOPED criteria, PISA-PED criteria are always conclusive and exhibits both high sensitivity       and specificity. The latter have, however, not gained the same widespread acceptance as the       PIOPED criteria. It remains uncertain which set of criteria is the better to confirm or       exclude the diagnosis of acute pulmonary. A prospective trial evaluating both PIOPED       criteria original and revised and PISA-PED criteria against a valid standard of reference       therefore seems appropriate.        The more resource demanding single photon emission computed tomography SPECT has recently       been subject to renewed interest in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism, but it       remains unclear whether this technique offers additional information compared to       conventional planar imaging. SPECT offers three-dimensional images, but otherwise the       technique is similar to the methods described for planar images. Combining the PISA-PED       criteria and SPECT imaging has not yet been tested in a prospective trial, but it seems       highly relevant.        Since the diagnosis is often suspected several times in the same patient, the ability to       distinguish acute and chronic changes in the scintigrams are essential. It is, however,       unclear to what extend and how fast the scintigraphic changes resolve. This has great       implications in scintigraphic control of patients recovering from acute pulmonary embolism.        A trial regarding the statements above requires a reliable method to test whether the       patient is suffering from acute pulmonary embolism or not: a standard of reference.       Pulmonary angiography is traditionally conceived as the standard of reference in acute       pulmonary embolism, but only a few newer studies employ this technique.        BACKGROUND FOR PURPOSE B Right heart strain is a common finding in acute pulmonary embolism.       It is a result of the sudden increase in pressure in the pulmonary circulation.       Ultrasonographic examination of the heart by echocardiography is suitable to demonstrate       this condition and this finding in a patient with acute pulmonary embolism is associated       with a considerably worse prognosis. The degree of right heart strain is not exclusively       determined by extension or size of the embolus. There is substantial evidence of the       influence of both co-morbidity and the release of vasoactive mediators on the extend of       right heart strain. The exact interplay between these three factors is not completely       understood in humans. Albeit, this can have significant implications on therapy, since       pharmacological manipulation of vascular tone in the pulmonary circulation is possible. This       treatment is, however, not without risk, and no well-designed study has yet addressed these       issues in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. Several case reports on successful       treatment with vasodilation, e.g. with inhaled nitric oxide, have been published. A more       profound understanding of the etiology of acute right heart failure in acute pulmonary       embolism is therefore desirable. What is the individual contribution of 1 clot burden, 2       release of vasoactive mediators, and 3 co-morbidity?        Recently, acute pulmonary embolism has been divided into three categories depending on       clinical presentation and echocardiographic findings: 1 massive; in which the patient       suffers from cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock. Most authorities agree that these patients       should be treated with fibrinolytic agents. 2 Non-massive; with no signs of shock or right       heart strain. In these patients there is no indication for fibrinolytic agents. 3       Sub-massive; with no manifestations of shock but echocardiographic findings consistent with       right heart strain. The indication for fibrinolytic treatment in this last group is       unresolved. This study will address whether simple methods, e.g. peripheral blood sampling       and perfusion scintigraphy can determine the primary mechanism in the generation of right       heart strain in the individual patient.        A later not yet planned intervention study based on the abovementioned knowledge could       then address the following question: Should the patient with sub-massive pulmonary embolism       receive treatment with fibrinolytic agents in the case of major clot burden and minor       degree of pulmonary vasoconstriction or vasodilators minor clot burden, major degree of       pulmonary vasoconstriction?

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00302692","TITLE:       Use of Beta Blockers in Elderly Trauma Patients SUMMARY:       Advances in medical care have increased the proportion of elderly Americans and enabled them       to remain more physically active. This has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the       number of geriatric patients admitted to trauma centers. The elderly constitute 23% of       trauma center admissions, but 36% of all trauma deaths. This disproportionately high       mortality is attributable to a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions, particularly,       cardiac disease. Multi-system injuries result in critical cardiac stress. Although       beta-blockade has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients at risk for       myocardial infarction after elective surgery, their use in trauma patients with potential       underlying cardiac disease has not been previously studied. We hypothesize that routine       administration of beta-blockers after resuscitation will reduce morbidity and mortality in       elderly trauma patients with, or at risk for, underlying cardiac disease.        This study is a randomized, prospective clinical trial. One cohort will receive routine       trauma intensive care, and the other, the same care plus beta-blockade after completion of       resuscitation. The primary outcome will be mortality. Secondary outcomes include MI, length       of stay, organ dysfunction, cardiac, and other complications.        Changes in outcome may not be due to reduction in myocardial oxygen demand and heart rate.       Laboratory studies demonstrate that circulating inflammatory cytokines contribute to cardiac       risk in trauma patients, and their production is influenced by adrenergic stimulation. We       will measure circulating IL-6, TNF alpha, IL-1beta, and measure NF-kB and p38 MAP kinase       activation in peripheral blood leukocytes, and determine the effect of beta-blockade on the       production of these inflammatory markers.        Finally, the wide variation in patient response to beta-blockers is attributed to genetic       variability in the adrenergic receptor. Therefore, we will identify single nucleotide       polymorphisms SNPS within the beta-adrenergic receptor, and determine their effects on       mortality and response to beta-blockade. This study will provide the first randomized,       prospective trial designed to reduce morbidity and mortality in elderly trauma patients at       risk for cardiac disease. The laboratory and genetic component will provide additional       insights that may explain treatment effects, lead to new therapeutic strategies, and have       the potential to lead to additional areas of investigation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Methods of Proposed Research          1. Study Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial.          2. Study Overview: All trauma patients admitted to the ICU > 55 years of age with a            primary diagnosis of injury will be screened on admission as study candidates. Patients            will be excluded if they have non-survivable injuries, are receiving comfort care only,            have an advanced directive limiting aggressive care, heart block, severe asthma,            bradycardia < 60 bpm, are on beta-blocker therapy, or are having an acute or evolving            myocardial infarction. Informed consent will be obtained. Some patients may be unable            to provide consent. In such cases, consent will be obtained from legal surrogates.            Consented patients will be randomized into an experimental or control group. Study            procedures will commence when end-points of resuscitation have been met for 12 hours,            defined as cessation of transfusion and fluid bolus requirements, a systolic blood            pressure > 100 mm Hg, heart rate < 130 bpm, adequate urine output, and a resolving base            deficit. The experimental group will receive beta-blockers adjusted to keep heart rate            60-80 bpm from the end of resuscitation to hospital discharge. A formal algorithm has            been developed for this purpose, and will be inserted into the admission order sheet.            Briefly, this will be achieved initially by titration of intravenous esmolol            hydrochloride until the patient remains at goal heart rate on a stable dose for 24            hours, then with IV or PO metoprolol. Therapy will be withheld in the event of            hypotension < 100 mmHg, or decreased cardiac index < 2.0 L/min/m2 accompanied by            signs of inadequate end-organ perfusion. The control group will receive the standard of            care for the injured geriatric patient. Such patients are not routinely provided with            beta-blocker therapy. However, beta-blockers will be used for treatment of excessive            tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and post myocardial infarction management, as clinically            indicated.          3. Baseline Data Collection: Will include; age, gender, demographic information, co-morbid            conditions, pre-injury medications, mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score,            Abbreviated Injury Severity Score AIS. In our intensive care unit, pulmonary artery            catheters are routinely inserted in critically injured elderly trauma patients who do            not respond to initial resuscitation. Patients with a PAC will have a complete            hemodynamic profile PAWP, CVP, MAP, PAM, CI, SV, SVRI, PVRI, LVSWI and O2 transport            profile SvO2, DO2I, VO2I recorded.

Blood will also be obtained            to measure baseline levels of markers of inflammation IL-6, IL-1, TNF, cardiac            injury troponin, as well as for peripheral blood leukocyte isolation for measurements            of p38 MAP kinase and NF-kB activation, and genotyping.          4. Resuscitation and Daily Management: Our intensive care unit is a closed unit staffed by            a group of six dedicated faculty, all of whom have certification in critical care.            Treatments, including resuscitation end-points, management of fluid/electrolytes,            ventilator therapy, weaning, evaluation/treatment of fever/sepsis, pain/sedation,            nutrition, as well as management of specific injury types, are provided according to            established clinical protocols, thus reducing or eliminating treatment bias and            potentially confounding management variations.          5. Outcome Measures:               1. Mortality: The primary outcome will be mortality. All patients will be followed                 from time of enrollment to study completion. Therefore, duration of follow-up will                 vary from 1-23 months.               2. Cardiac Events: ICU records flow charts, labs, ECG will be screened daily for                 evidence of dysrhythmia, ischemia/MI, and hypotension. Diagnosis of MI will be                 based on clinical symptoms, ECG changes, cardiac biomarkers, and autopsy data, if                 available. Studies on the detection of myocardial infarction demonstrate that                 incidence is dependent on the type, frequency, and timing of a diagnostic test, as                 well as the criteria being used. Our study will base the determination of MI on                 the consensus document of the Joint European Society of Cardiology/American                 College of Cardiology Committee for the redefinition of MI.47 The timing of                 diagnostic tests will be based on the AHA guidelines for myocardial infarction                 surveillance for high and intermediate risk patients after major surgical                 procedures. Accordingly, an ECG will be obtained at baseline, daily for two days,                 after any surgical procedure, and at ICU discharge. Biochemical markers will be                 obtained at baseline, after any surgical procedure, daily for two days, and on day                 4 or day of ICU discharge whichever comes first.26 Classification of cardiac                 events will be done by individuals blinded to group assignment.               3. Infection/Organ Dysfunction: ICU records will be screened daily for evidence of                 infection fever, altered WBC, pneumonia, abdominal abscess, UTI, line sepsis.                 Sepsis and MOD will be calculated by individuals blinded to group allocation.               4. Length of Stay: ICU stay, ventilator days, and hospital stay will be recorded.          6. Laboratory Procedures:               1. Serum Troponins: Serum cardiac troponin I will be determined by ELISA.               2. Inflammatory Markers: WBCs will be isolated from whole blood by centrifugation,                 and nuclear proteins isolated to measure NF-kB nuclear translocation. Nuclear                 protein extracts will be assayed by ELISA with the TransAM NF-kB p65 activation                 assay to determine the degree of NF-kB activation following LPS stimulation. The                 amount of translocated NF-kB will be standardized to total protein content, which                 will be determined in a standard Bradford assay.48 Activation of p38 MAP kinase                 will be conducted with the p38 MAP kinase assay kit. Briefly, a monoclonal                 phoso-specific antibody to p38 MAP kinase Thr180/Tyr182 is used to selectively                 immunoprecipitate active p38 MAP kinase from the cell lysates. The resulting                 immunoprecipitate is incubated with ATF-2 fusion protein in the presence of ATP                 and kinase buffer. This allows immunoprecipitated active p38 MAP kinase to                 phosphorylate ATF-2. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr71 is measured by Western                 blotting using a phosphor-ATF-2 Thr71 antibody.                  IL-6 concentrations in plasma will be determined by conventional ELISA, using                 OptEIATM Sets. Briefly, a plate is coated with a monoclonal antibody that is                 specific for IL-6. Standards and samples are added to the wells, and any IL-6                 present binds to the immobilized antibody. The wells are washed and incubated at                 room temperature with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate mixed with a                 biotinylated anti-human IL-6 antibody. The wells are again washed and a TMB                 substrate solution is added producing a color change. The microwell absorbances                 are read at 450 nm. The concentration of IL-6 is directly proportional to the                 color intensity of the test sample.               3. Sequencing of Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Genotype: The Ser49Gly and Arg399Gly SNP’s                 of the adrenergic receptor will be amplified by polymerase chain reaction PCR.                 Genotypes will be assayed by pyrosequencing and DNA sequence analysis. Genomic DNA                 will be extracted from whole blood by ammonium acetate-ethanol precipitation and                 the yield quantified by comparison of staining intensity relative to lanes                 containing known concentrations of standards.49 Fragments containing each of the                 SNP’s will be individually PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using a thermal profile,                 reaction conditions, and primer sequences specific for each SNP. All genotypes                 will be determined by pyrosequence analysis using PSQ 96 SNP Software. Each SNP                 will be assayed with a specific primer sequence, which will enable the scoring of                 heterozygotes and alternate homozygotes with equal reliability. Amplification                 conditions have been established and optimized for more than two dozen loci in our                 laboratory over the past two years. The addition of new candidate SNPs has become                 a routine matter. We have utilized these protocols to generate genotype data for                 more than 20 SNP’s in over 600 individuals that have been published five                 manuscripts over the past several years. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  All trauma patients admitted to the ICU > 55 years of age with a primary diagnosis of              injury will be screened on admission as study candidates.          Exclusion Criteria:            -  Patients will be excluded if they have non-survivable injuries, are receiving comfort              care only, have an advanced directive limiting aggressive care, heart block, severe              asthma, bradycardia < 60 bpm, are on beta-blocker therapy, or are having an acute              or evolving myocardial infarction.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Official Title: Compassionate Use of Catheter Thrombectomy Aspirex 11F in Patients With       Massive Pulmonary Embolism        Principal Investigator: Nils Kucher, MD, Cardiovascular Division, Interventional Cardiology,       Andreas Grüntzig Catheterization Laboratories, Raemistrasse 100 University Hospital Zurich,       8091 Zurich, Switzerland, Phone: +41 1 255 8762, kuchernils@yahoo.com        Sponsor: Straub Medical AG, Straubstrasse, 73 23 Wangs, Schweiz        August 29, 2005        I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE        A Historical Background        Acute pulmonary embolism PE is a potentially life-threatening disease with an overall       3-month mortality rate that exceeds 15%, with right ventricular RV dysfunction as the most       common cause of death 1. The 30-day mortality rate in patients with massive PE, defined as       cardiogenic shock or a systemic systolic pressure < 90 mm Hg, exceeds 30%. In patients with       massive PE, systemic thrombolysis 2 or surgical embolectomy 3-5 in addition to       anticoagulation may be life-saving, facilitating rapid reversal of RV failure and       cardiogenic shock. Catheter-directed thrombolysis aims to accelerate clot lysis and achieve       rapid reperfusion of pulmonary arteries 6. Rapid recanalization of pulmonary arteries by       thrombolysis 7,8 or embolectomy 4 may improve functional class, decrease the risk of       recurrence, and prevent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. However,       approximately 35% patients are not eligible for thrombolysis because of major       contraindications, such as recent surgery, trauma, or cancer 9. PE thrombolysis is       accompanied by a particularly high risk of bleeding complications. Among 304 patients from       the International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism registry ICOPER who received PE       thrombolysis, 66 21.7% suffered major bleeding and 9 3.0% had intracranial bleeding 1.        Few tertiary care centers offer emergency surgical embolectomy with round-the-clock       availability 3. This operation mandates a median sternotomy, circulatory arrest with       cardiopulmonary bypass, and incision of the main pulmonary arteries. In the 2 largest PE       registries, surgical embolectomy was used in only 1% of patients with massive PE and       cardiogenic shock.        The only alternative to thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy for reversing PE-related right       heart failure and cardiogenic shock is percutaneous catheter thrombectomy 10,11. Catheter       thrombectomy is particularly important when contraindications to thrombolysis are present or       when surgical embolectomy is not feasible or not available.        An ideal percutaneous PE thrombectomy catheter should be: 1 highly maneuverable to allow       rapid right heart passage and advancement into major pulmonary arteries, 2 effective in       removing obstructing thrombi from major pulmonary arteries to facilitate rapid improvement       in hemodynamics, reversing right heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and 3 safe without       causing damage to cardiac structures and pulmonary arteries, and without causing significant       blood loss, distal thrombus embolization, and mechanical hemolysis. An ideal PE thrombectomy       catheter device is currently not available.        The Greenfield suction embolectomy catheter has been available the longest and is the only       PE catheter device approved by the Food and Drug Administration 12,13. However, its       limitations include a very large catheter size, requiring a surgical cutdown at the venous       puncture site, as well as its stiffness, with difficulty manipulating the catheter to the       desired location within the pulmonary vascular tree. In addition, there is a substantial       risk of re-embolization because the aspiration pressure may not be sufficient to hold the       thrombus in place while removing the catheter with the thrombus trapped within the suction       cap. Thrombus fragmentation without embolectomy using balloon angioplasty or a pigtail       rotational catheter has also been reported 15-17. Macroembolization, however, may cause       further deterioration of hemodynamics when a large centrally located thrombus breaks and       embolizes into a previously non-obstructed lobar branch 17. Several mechanical or       rheolytic embolectomy devices, including Angiojet Possis, Minneapolis, MN, Amplatz clot       buster BARD-Microvena, White Bear Lake, MN, or Hydrolyser Cordis, Warren, NJ, were not       designed for the use in the large-sized main pulmonary arteries but were investigated in       small PE cohort studies 18-23. These catheter devices have limited efficacy to treat       massive PE and are plagued by complications that include mechanical hemolysis, and macro- or       microembolization 23. Mechanical hemolysis occurs when macerated blood or thrombus is not       removed by the catheter. Transient mechanical hemolysis of 24-48 hours duration was reported       following catheter thrombectomy, particularly with the Amplatz device and with hydrodynamic       devices such as the Angiojet catheter 23.        Catheter thrombectomy is used in only up to 5% of patients with massive PE and cardiogenic       shock 1. In summary, potentially life-saving therapy, including surgical embolectomy or       catheter thrombectomy is withheld in up to 30% of patients with massive PE and       contraindication to thrombolysis.        B The Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy device        An ideal percutaneous PE thrombectomy catheter should be: 1 highly maneuverable to allow       rapid right heart passage and advancement into major pulmonary arteries, 2 effective in       removing obstructing thrombi from major pulmonary arteries to facilitate rapid improvement       in hemodynamics, reversing right heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and 3 safe without       causing damage to cardiac structures and pulmonary arteries, and without causing significant       blood loss, distal thrombus embolization, and mechanical hemolysis. An ideal PE thrombectomy       catheter device is currently not available.        The Aspirex catheter thrombectomy device Straub Medical, Wangs, Switzerland was       specifically designed and developed for percutaneous interventional treatment of PE in       pulmonary arteries, ranging from 6-14 mm in caliber. The central part of the catheter system       is a high-speed rotational coil within the catheter body that: 1 creates negative pressure       through an L-shaped aspiration port at the catheter tip, 2 macerates aspirated thrombus,       and 3 removes macerated thrombus. The aspiration capacity of the Aspirex device was       adjusted to remove thrombus from obstructed major pulmonary arteries and to minimize the       risk of vascular collapse and vessel wall engagement. This was achieved by adjusting the       caliber of the device, the pitch of the rotational coil, motor speed, and size or       configuration of the aspiration port at the catheter tip.        Aspirated blood cools off and lubricates the catheter system. The design of the Aspirex       catheter does not allow recirculation of aspirated blood. In static in-vitro tests using       human blood samples, aspiration with the Aspirex device was not associated with an increase       in plasma free hemoglobin 24. Catheter introduction and thrombectomy mandate the use of a       12-French sheath inserted into the internal jugular or femoral vein. A pigtail or       balloon-tipped catheter is required to place an exchange guide wire in the pulmonary artery.       The Aspirex device is then introduced over the wire. An 80-cm 12-French sheath instead of a       standard size 12-French sheath may be used to: 1 provide more support to introduce the       Aspirex device into the pulmonary arteries, 2 to monitor right ventricular or pulmonary       artery pressures, and 3 to inject contrast agent for pulmonary angiography. The distal part       of the catheter shaft has enhanced flexibility, facilitating right heart passage and       selective advancement into proximal pulmonary arteries Table 1.        Table 1 Technical specifications for the Aspirex PE thrombectomy catheter 24          -  Length 120 cm          -  Maximum external diameter 11 F          -  Sheath compatibility 12 F          -  Guide wire compatibility Hydrophilic, 0.035 inch, length 260 cm          -  Catheter body Polyurethane, stainless steel, perfluoroethylenepropylene          -  Flexible catheter tip length 41 cm          -  Motor-catheter connection magnetic clutch with torque lock          -  Rotary speed 32,500 rpm          -  Speed torque 25 mNm          -  Maximum aspiration pressure* 11.3 kPA          -  Minimum catheter bend radius 21 mm * measured in a closed static in-vitro system.        C. In vivo tests        Pulmonary embolization 24:        Following general anesthesia, a median cervicotomy was performed to obtain access to jugular       vessels in 13 pigs 44.5 kg. A 24-French sheath was surgically inserted into the right       external jugular vein 24; 6-French sheaths were placed into the left external jugular       vein, left internal jugular vein, and right common carotid artery, respectively. Following       intravenous administration of 5000 units of unfractionated heparin, 5-French pigtail       catheters were advanced over a J-tipped 0.035-inch guide wire Emerald, Cordis, Miami, FL       into the ascending aorta and superior vena cava. Two porcine 4-day old thrombi, 5-6 cm in       length and 1-2 cm in diameter, were injected with 20 ml saline solution through the       24-French sheath using a tapered adapter 24. The tapered adapter allowed intact injection of       thrombi through the sheath. A third thrombus was injected in 4 animals because the mean       aortic pressure remained > 70 mm Hg or the mean pulmonary artery pressure remained < 25 mm       Hg after injection of 2 thrombi. Total injected thrombus weight was 17.4 g. Of the 13 pigs,       3 died immediately after thrombus injection due to cardiogenic shock. Ten pigs developed       cardiogenic shock but nevertheless survived; two required intravenous epinephrine bolus of       1 mg for profound systemic arterial hypotension following thrombus injection.        Catheter thrombectomy:        Thrombectomy was initiated immediately after a drop in mean aortic pressure to less than 70       mm HG or an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure to > 25 mm Hg were achieved.       Following embolization, a 260-cm J-tipped exchange wire Terumo, Leuven, Belgium was       advanced via the 24-French sheath into the distal right or left pulmonary artery, passing       the proximal occlusion site. The thrombectomy catheter was introduced over the exchange       guide wire and then advanced into a proximal occlusion site. The catheter device was gently       withdrawn during aspiration. Catheter embolectomy was performed in the main pulmonary       artery, right and left main and right and left lower lobe pulmonary arteries but not in       upper lobe pulmonary arteries or segmental branches. Thrombectomy was discontinued as soon       as the mean aortic pressure increased to > 70 mmHg or the mean pulmonary artery pressure       decreased to < 25 mmHg, regardless of the angiographic result. In one animal, the right but       not left embolized lung was left untreated to investigate macroscopic and microscopic       changes due to embolization; the left lung was treated with the Aspirex catheter.        Necropsy:        After en bloc resection of the heart and lungs, all cardiac structures were examined       macroscopically, including the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, and pulmonic       valve, as well as the main pulmonary artery, right and left pulmonary artery for rupture,       perforation, dissection, or hemorrhage. Lung specimens were examined macroscopically for       hemorrhage, edema, or atelectasis. After partial fixation in 4% formaldehyde solution, lung       specimens were cut transversely into 1-cm sections and evaluated macroscopically for       perforation and dissection of treated and untreated pulmonary artery segments. After partial       fixation in 4% formaldehyde solution, lung specimens were cut transversally into 1-cm       sections and evaluated macroscopically for perforation and dissection of treated and       untreated pulmonary artery segments. After complete fixation, representative samples 8-10       per lung were paraffin-embedded, cut into 3 micrometer sections, and stained with       hematoxylin-eosin and van Gieson combined with Weigerts method for elastic fiber staining       Weigert-van Gieson for histological evaluation of the vessel wall integrity. The       microscopic endpoints included perforation, dissection, or hemorrhage of treated vascular       segments.        II. SPECIFIC AIMS AND HYPOTHESES        We will introduce a compassionate use protocol for treating 50 patients with massive PE by       percutaneous catheter thrombectomy at selected academic hospitals in Switzerland, Germany,       and the United States, using the Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy device.

The enrollment of a patient in this       compassionate use protocol requires agreement from: 1 the responsible attending physician,       and 2 the interventional cardiologist on call, and the cardiovascular surgeon on call.        Because of the limited prognosis with massive PE, patients cannot provide informed consent       to participate in this compassionate use protocol. Initially, written informed consent will       be obtained from a physician not involved in the compassionate use protocol. Physician       investigators will obtain written informed consent in all patients after completion of the       PE catheter thrombectomy if the patient is consentable. The patient will be asked to       participate in study-related procedures, including the measurement of plasma free hemoglobin       from blood obtained during the procedure, echocardiography 24-72 hours after the procedure,       and a telephone interview 3-6 months after the procedure.        V. STUDY PROCEDURES        The study-related procedures are the following:          1. measurement of plasma free hemoglobin after completion of the procedure in the            catheterization laboratory. Five ml blood will be withdrawn from an existing vascular            access site, without the need for additional venipuncture.          2. echocardiography 24-72 hours after the procedure to assess recovery of right            ventricular function.          3. clinical follow-up by telephone interview 3-6 months after the procedure.        A Baseline hemodynamic measurements, pulmonary angiography          1. Type and cross 2 units of packed red blood cells.          2. Gain vascular access, preferably the right femoral vein using a standard 12-F sheath.          3. Perform a manual injection with 5-10 ml of contrast to rule out iliac and inferior vena            cava thrombosis.          4. May exchange for an 80-cm 12-F sheath to: 1 provide more support to introduce the            Aspirex device into the pulmonary arteries, 2 to monitor right ventricular or            pulmonary artery pressures during thrombectomy, and 3 to inject contrast for pulmonary            angiography without removing the thrombectomy device from the pulmonary artery.             Alternatively, the contralateral femoral vein or jugular vein may be accessed to            advance a diagnostic catheter into the right ventricle or main pulmonary trunk.          5. Obtain pressure tracings from right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and            oxygen saturation from the right atrium and pulmonary artery. Obtain arterial oxygen            saturation if arterial sheath in place or document oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry.          6. Perform pulmonary angiography using digital subtraction angiography DSA. Cine            angiography should be used only if the patient is not intubated and cannot hold breath            for at least 5-8 seconds. The standard Grollman catheter, standard curved pigtail            catheter, or another angiographic catheter may be used to achieve the desired position            for pulmonary angiography. Perform a manual injection of 5-10 cc contrast with the            catheter tip in the pulmonary main trunk to localize emboli in the right or left main            pulmonary artery. Advance the catheter into the right or left pulmonary artery and            perform selective angiography in the frontal view using 20 cc of contrast per 2 seconds            via a power injector. Higher contrast volumes should not be used to avoid worsening of            right heart failure. The second standard view 45 degree ipsilateral posterior oblique            view should be used only when biplane imaging is available. If both main pulmonary            arteries are to be treated, selective angiography should be performed for both lungs            separately.        B Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy          1. Obtain the activated clotting time ACT and adjust the heparin dose to achieve an ACT            between 300 and 350 to avoid malfunction of the thrombectomy device. Bivalirudin            Angiox may be used if the patient has a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.          2. Introduce a 0.035 inch, 260-cm exchange-length J-tipped Terumo wire into the            angiographic catheter and advance the wire into a distal lobar or proximal segmental            branch by crossing the occlusion site. Confirm wire position in the main and lobar            pulmonary arteries using a manual injection of 5-10 ml contrast. Remove the            angiographic catheter and introduce the Aspirex catheter device over the wire using a            torquer to hold the Terumo wire in place.          3. Advance the Aspirex device into the proximal occlusion site. During thrombectomy, the            Aspirex device should be gently advanced to the distal occlusion site and then pulled            back while continuing aspiration. During thrombectomy, rotate the Aspirex device gently            to allow for maximum contact of the L-shaped aspiration port with the thrombus. The            maximum time for one thrombectomy pass should not exceed 10 seconds to avoid vessel            wall engagement during aspiration and unnecessary blood loss. Do not advance the            Aspirex device into segmental arteries to avoid perforation or dissection. Thrombectomy            should be discontinued as soon as the systemic arterial pressure increases or the            pulmonary artery pressure decreases, regardless of the angiographic result. The Aspirex            device should not be used without the Terumo wire.          4. Several thrombectomy passes may be required to recanalize the main or lobar pulmonary            arteries and to improve hemodynamics. If both pulmonary arteries need to be treated,            exchange the Aspirex device for a pigtail, multipurpose catheter, or other angiographic            catheter to probe the contralateral pulmonary artery with the Terumo wire, and repeat            step 3.        C Post thrombectomy hemodynamic measurements and pulmonary angiography          1. After completion of thrombectomy, obtain pressure tracings from right atrium, right            ventricle, pulmonary artery, and oxygen saturation from the right atrium and pulmonary            artery. Obtain arterial oxygen saturation if arterial sheath in place or document            oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry.          2. Perform selective pulmonary angiography of the treated lungs in the frontal view using            20 cc of contrast per 2 seconds via a power injector. The second standard view 45            degree ipsilateral posterior oblique view should be used only if biplane imaging is            available to avoid unnecessary volume overload.          3. If an inferior vena cava filter is to be inserted, this must be performed after            completion of thrombectomy.        D Post thrombectomy plasma free hemoglobin level        Obtain a blood sample from the venous sheath for measurement of plasma free hemoglobin        E Echocardiography 24 to72 hours post thrombectomy        Echocardiography will be performed 24-72 hours after thrombectomy for evaluating right       ventricular function, right ventricular dilatation, tricuspid and pulmonic valve function,       and for ruling our pericardial effusion.        F Clinical follow-up        Clinical follow-up will be performed by telephone interview 3-6 months after the procedure.       The aim is to determine symptoms and survival.        VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS        A Sample size assumptions        Sample size calculation was based on a study of 20 patients with massive PE in which       percutaneous catheter intervention was associated with an immediate reduction in mean PAP       from 31,6 to 28,8 mm Hg 15.        Estimated sample size for one-sample comparison of mean to hypothesized value STATA       Corporation:        alpha = 0.05 two-sided Power beta = 90% Baseline mean PAP mm Hg = 31 Baseline mean PAP       standard deviation = 6 Follow-up mean PAP mm Hg = 28 Estimated sample size n = 43        B Data analysis        We will perform repeated measures ANOVA tests to compare baseline with follow-up       measurements, with Bonferronis adjustment for multiple comparisons. The following       continuous variables will be compared pre and post thrombectomy: mean PAP, PVR, cardiac       output, cardiac index, systolic arterial cuff pressure, angiographic Miller index.        VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS        Major risks from pulmonary angiography and PE catheter thrombectomy include perforation and       dissection of cardiovascular structures and of treated or untreated pulmonary arteries, with       pericardial tamponade, hemothorax, and pulmonary hemorrhage as the most serious       consequences. The risk of these complications during diagnostic pulmonary angiography is       less than 0.5% but they may occur more frequently during pulmonary thrombectomy.       Thrombectomy should only be performed in the main and lobar and not in segmental pulmonary       arteries to minimize the risk of perforation or dissection. Thrombectomy should be       terminated as soon as hemodynamic improvement is achieved, regardless of the angiographic       result. In addition, catheter thrombectomy must be performed with surgical back-up, i.e.,       with immediate availability of a cardiovascular surgical team and an operating room with       cardiopulmonary bypass. In case of a perforation, the interventional cardiologist will       reverse or minimize anticoagulation, insert a pericardial drain, or place a balloon catheter       to cover the vascular perforation site.        Injection of contrast agent is required to localize obstructing pulmonary emboli and to       control the success of the thrombectomy procedure. There is risk of worsening right       ventricular failure with contrast injection in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. The       contrast injection volumes and rates must therefore be minimized in patients with       end-diastolic PAP > 25 mm Hg.        Other potential complications include arrhythmia, tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation,       vascular access complications, including hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula, and       anaphylactic reaction to iodine contrast. Bleeding may occur at any site from       anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin. Renal failure may occur due to the       use of iodine contrast for pulmonary angiography, particularly in patients with preexisting       renal dysfunction.        One disadvantage of the Aspirex device is that blood is extracted during thrombectomy.       Prolonged aspiration may potentially cause hemodynamic deterioration in patients with       PE-related shock. In patients with a massive thrombus load, prolonged thrombectomy may be       required to reverse cardiogenic shock but may result in significant blood loss. In this       situation, transfusion of 1 or 2 units of packed red blood cells may be necessary.        Catheter thrombectomy may occasionally be ineffective to remove centrally located pulmonary       emboli and to reverse cardiogenic shock. Surgical embolectomy should then be considered for       failed catheter thrombectomy.        The sponsor of the study, Straub Medical AG, Wangs, Switzerland has contracted an insurance       to cover costs for device-related damage or death. Since the mortality from massive PE is       exceedingly high and patients may die despite a technically successful procedure, the       insurance will not cover events that are not related to device-related damage.        VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS        Catheter thrombectomy to treat massive PE can rapidly reverse acute right ventricular       failure and cardiogenic shock and therefore is potentially life-saving. Catheter       thrombectomy represents the only reperfusion strategy when contraindications to thrombolysis       are present or when surgical embolectomy is not feasible or not readily available. In       addition, catheter thrombectomy is a minimally invasive interventional therapy without the       need for cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of the failing right ventricle. If no       reperfusion therapy, including thrombolysis, catheter thrombectomy, or surgical embolectomy       in addition to anticoagulation is initiated, the risk of death during hospitalization in       patients with massive PE exceeds 30% 7,10.        Standard therapy with thrombolysis is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage,       and intracranial hemorrhage was reported in up to 3% of the patients with massive PE 1. In       comparison to thrombolysis, catheter thrombectomy causes fewer systemic bleeding       complications, including the most serious complication of intracranial hemorrhage.        IX.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00314548","TITLE:       Inhaled Prostacyclin for Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS and Pulmonary Hypertension SUMMARY:       Summary of the proposed research:        The intravenous application of prostacyclin PGE1 or its stable analogue, iloprost, has       been used to cause a decrease not only of the pulmonary but also of the systemic vascular       tone. Aerosolized prostacyclin, on the other hand, can result in a selective pulmonary       vasodilatation without affecting the systemic blood pressure as shown in preliminary       studies/case reports. No large trials exist for this type of use of the drug so far.       Furthermore, aerosolized PGI2 can improve gas exchange and pulmonary shunt in clinical       settings of impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio as it occurs in adult respiratory distress       syndrome ARDS due to the redistribution of pulmonary blood flow from non-ventilated to       ventilated, aerosol accessible lung regions. Therefore, the investigators propose to carry       out a prospective, double blinded, randomized trial to show that the nebulized iloprost       decreases pulmonary hypertension selectively and improves oxygenation in ARDS. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Introduction:        Pulmonary hypertension, defined as mean PA pulmonary arterial pressure of > 25 mm Hg, is       an end point of a variety of conditions. These include primary pulmonary hypertension,       post-operative pulmonary hypertension and as a result of increased pulmonary vascular       resistance that occurs in ARDS. This is an entity distinguished by hypoxemia,       non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Prostacyclin       PGE1, an arachidonic acid metabolite, or its stable analogue, iloprost, has been evaluated       for its efficacy in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and for its use in reducing       intra-pulmonary shunting in ARDS. While the intravenous application of iloprost can cause a       decrease not only of the pulmonary but also of the systemic vascular tone, the aerosolized       prostacyclin can result in a selective pulmonary vasodilatation without affecting the       systemic blood pressure as demonstrated in preliminary studies/reports. Furthermore,       aerosolized iloprost can improve gas exchange and pulmonary shunt in clinical settings of       impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio as it occurs in ARDS, due to the redistribution of       pulmonary blood flow from non-ventilated to ventilated, aerosol accessible lung regions.        Previous case reports and non-randomized studies have indicated that inhalation of       aerosolized iloprost may offer a new life saving strategy in intractable pulmonary       hypertension and ARDS. Further, advantages of inhaled iloprost include the lack of adverse       reactions and toxic side effects as well as convenient and more cost-effective       administration. Other available therapies like nitric oxide inhalation costs more, around Rs       350/liter and a total of 34-45 liters per patient is required. It is also associated with       additional side effects, such as thrombocytopenia. Due to the irreversible nature of ARDS       associated with high rate of mortality also affecting resource allocation in critically ill       patients, we suggest carrying out this study in our intensive care unit ICU, where the       incidence is > 10% resulting in almost 90% mortality ICU Quality Indicators Jan-Apr 20048.       Iloprost is completely metabolized and excretion of metabolites is primarily via the       kidneys; the elimination half-life is 30 minutes. Inhalation therapy reduces systemic       absorption and hence elimination half-life.        In a previous study, aerosolized iloprost was found effective in improving the functional       class of the patient, exercise capacity and improved shunting. However, large randomized       trials are needed to prove the efficacy of this cost effective therapy in patients with       pulmonary hypertension and ARDS.        Objectives:        To carry out a prospective, double blinded, randomized trial to show that the nebulized       PGE1, a stable prostacyclin derivative, decreases pulmonary hypertension selectively and       improves oxygenation in ARDS.        *ALPROSTADIL 20 mcg ampule manufactured by Schering, Pakistan.        Importance of work:        Prostacyclin PGE1, an arachidonic acid metabolite, has been evaluated for its efficacy in       the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and for its use in reducing intra-pulmonary shunting       in ARDS. While the intravenous application PGE1, or alprostadil, can cause a decrease not       only of the pulmonary but also of the systemic vascular tone, the aerosolized PGE1 results       in a selective pulmonary vasodilation without affecting the systemic blood pressure.       Furthermore, aerosolized PGE1 can improve gas exchange and pulmonary shunt in clinical       settings of impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio as it occurs in ARDS, due to the       redistribution of pulmonary blood flow from non-ventilated to ventilated, aerosol accessible       lung regions.        Critical review of relevant literature on the subject:        Previous case reports and non randomized studies have indicated that inhalation of       aerosolized alprostadil may offer a new life saving strategy in intractable pulmonary       hypertension and ARDS. Further, advantages of inhaled iloprost include the lack of adverse       reactions and toxic side effects as well as convenient and more cost-effective       administration. Due to the irreversible nature of ARDS associated with high rate of       mortality also affecting resource allocation in critically ill patients, we suggest carrying       out this study in our intensive care unit ICU, where the incidence is > 10% resulting in       almost 90% mortality ICU Quality Indicators Jan-Apr 20048.        In a previous study, aerosolized alprostadil was effective in improving the functional class       of the patient, exercise capacity and improved shunting. Large randomized trials are needed       to prove the efficacy of this cost effective therapy in patients with pulmonary hypertension       and ARDS. Other available therapies like nitric oxide inhalation costs higher around Rs       350/liter and a total of 34-45 liters per patient is required. It is also associated with       additional side effects, such as thrombocytopenia.        Resume of any related work carried out by the principal investigator or co-Investigator in       this area:        The principal investigator and co-investigator have the relevant qualification, experience       and expertise to conduct this study, as is obvious from the list of recent selected       publications.        Controls:        From selected patients included in the study in a random, blinded manner. Patients will be       given a drug or placebo to be determined by pharmacy.        Work Up:        After enrolling, the following tests will be carried out to determine inclusion/ exclusion       criteria.          -  Transthoracic echo - to rule out ejection fraction < 30%          -  Pulmonary embolus          -  Pulmonary hypertension TR jet to be determined by echo          -  Arterial blood gas          -  CXR reviewed to determine ARDS criteria        Drug Administration:        Drug alprostadil/placebo - normal saline to be nebulized; 5 micrograms via standard       nebulizer within 4 hours, once.        Standardization of Critical Care:        Standardization of treatment modalities have been incorporated in the methodology with       regard to ventilatory support, inotropic support and fluid management; however, as the       intensive care unit at the AKUH is an open unit where patients are primarily taken care of       by the primary teams and a critical care consultant of which the PI is one, strict       guidelines cannot be enforced. However we have given a general range of parameters, keeping       in mind the recommendations of the Society of Critical Care medicine and the Acute       Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network.        Once enrolled, the patients will be managed by the ICU consultant and the primary physician       may not always include PI. The following broad criteria will be followed in order to treat       the patient:          1. Ventilatory support in ARDS/Pulmonary hypertension:               -  Any ventilatory mode can be used               -  Peak airway pressures Pa will be maintained under 35 mm Hg               -  Peep range to be between 8-14 mm Hg               -  Tidal volumes of 6 cc/kg          2. Inotropic Support:             Dopamine 5-20 mics/kg/min as a positive inotrope dopaminergic, alpha and beta            agonist activity and norepinephrine 0.1-0.5 mics/kg/min as a vasopressor alpha            agonist are used for increasing blood pressure. The goal will be to maintain a mean            arterial pressure DBP plus 1/3 rd of pulse pressure of > 60 mm Hg.          3. Fluid management:        Keeping a wedge pressure < 20 mm Hg will be the goal of fluid management.        Sample Size:        Assuming total Karachi population of over 150,000 1998 Demographic Survey of Pakistan of       all age groups, and taking incidence of 20% +/- 105 bound of error of pulmonary       hypertension and ARDS at 95% confidence interval, we extricated a sample size to be 91 cases       with 91 controls. Epi-info version 1.1 was used to calculate sample size. Actual sample       size 182.        Outcome Measures:          -  If met, trial will be terminated early in favor of using the drug. Positive result will            be taken as PA pressures - mean PA pressure decreases by 10 in 4 hours and PaO2/FiO2            ratio - increases by 50 or PaO2 increases by 10 in 4 hours.          -  Results will be recorded in a Data Sheet - see Appendix I.        Tests done: Arterial blood gases. Transthoracic echo before and after drug.        Ethics: Written approval of Aga Khan University Ethics Review Committee ERC has been       obtained prior to commencement of the study.        Blinding: Each patient after enrollment will be assigned a serial number consecutively after       meeting inclusion criteria reviewed by the principal investigator and research assistant.       After the necessary workup and consent, drug shall be obtained from the AKUH pharmacy. The       pharmacy will carry out randomization and deliver either alprostadil or normal saline       placebo in an unmarked vial. Delivery dose and frequency will be carried out similarly for       all patients. Data will be collected by the research assistant and nurse.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Analgesia is an important element in the management of ACS patients. Pain contributes to the       heightened sympathetic activity that is particularly prominent during periods of acute       STEMI, NSTEMI and unstable angina and consequentially causes elevation of tissue oxygen       demand. Control of cardiac pain is typically accomplished with a combination of oxygen,       analgesic e.g. morphine beta blockers agents and primarily nitrates.        Sublingual nitrates are currently the guidelines recommended preparation for instant relief       of brief episodes of pain. In patients with prolonged periods of waxing and waning chest       pain, drip of intravenous nitrates may be of benefit in controlling of symptoms and       correcting ischemia.        Intravenous nitrates are also indicated for the treatment of acute decompensated CHF       patients with pulmonary edema, nevertheless the current treatment for these patients edema       is repeated intravenous boluses of and not sublingual isosorbide dinitrate, followed by       continuous drip. Although there is no hard data on intravenous high-dose nitrates for the       relief of acute anginal pain episodes, our clinical impression with this method is       excellent.        Intravenous boluses of isosorbide dinitrate in a hospital setting provides immediate,       accurate bioavailability  and is an easily controlled modality for providing nitrates.        Since intravenous boluses of isosorbide dinitrate is the standard care for acute anginal       pain episodes in our ICCU at this time, a well designed comparative study for the two       methods would help it to become a guideline and not a matter of choice in these cases.

We will test       the hypotheses that uterine leiomyomas are heterogeneous in terms of their growth       characteristics and in their clinical symptoms or outcomes, and that differences in       leiomyoma growth dynamics can be discriminated by molecular markers and cellular phenotypes.       Participants will include 300 premenopausal women greater than 18 years old with at least       one uterine leiomyoma. The inclusion criteria for patient enrollment is confirmed diagnosis       of leiomyoma by ultrasound. At least one leiomyoma must be equal to or greater than 2 cm in       diameter and the uterus must be enlarged to the size typical during the eigth week of       pregnancy. After enrollment and informed consent, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance       image MRI scans will be conducted beginning at the first visit and then at 3, 6, and 12       months.

If women become pregnant during         the study, they wil have the option to stay in the study, but will have pelvic ultrasound         scans in place of MRI scans.          Women who are taking or likely to start taking GnRH therapy will be excluded because this         therapy, which is used as a treatment method for leiomyomas, sometmes induces their         regression.          Women who are greater than 52 inches in circumference or greater than 350 pounds will be         excluded because they will be too large to fit in the imaging equipment.          Women that have an intra-uterine device IUD will be excluded because these metal devices         create shadowing in MR images, making accurate measurement and interpretation of         leiomyomas in the MRIs difficult.          Women are not excluded if they had a prior myomectomy, or if they are taking oral         contraceptives.          The inclusion of only women of premenopausal age greater than 18 years old in this study         is dictated by the nature of the condition. ");

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background: Uterine leiomyomas are the leading cause of hysterectomy in the United States,       accounting for over 200,000 procedures each year. Most epidemiologic studies of uterine       leiomyoma show that parity has a protective association with leiomyoma, but the mechanism is       not known. Both epidemiologic data and data from an animal model indicate that the       protective association is not an artifact resulting from reduced fertility among women with       fibroids. We hypothesize that the process of uterine regression following delivery results       in loss of small fibroids due to selective apoptosis of transformed cells and the extensive       remodeling of the entire uterus.        Study Objectives: Monitor fibroids during pregnancy and after postpartum uterine regression       to assess any loss of fibroids and change in size of fibroids.        Methods: Add a postpartum ultrasound examination to an existing epidemiologic study of       pregnant women. The parent study documents fibroid number, size, and location with a 7 week       ultrasound examination. With the additional postpartum ultrasound proposed here, data on       fibroid number, size, and location through pregnancy and postpartum uterine regression will       be collected on approximately 400 women. A subsample of 30 women will also have an MRI after       their postpartum ultrasound in order to evaluate the sensitivity of ultrasound imaging.        Significance: This study will provide the first data on fibroid change with       parturition/postpartum uterine regression for a large sample of women. If small fibroids       disappear during this time, it will document a process that results in natural regression       of these tumors in premenopausal women. Insights from the biology of this process may be       useful in developing treatment that could be used by nonpregnant women with fibroids to       induce tumor regression.

Those who are found to have fibroids at either         their 7-week, or 22-week ultrasound examination are eligible for this further         postpregnancy study.          A small substudy of 30 women having MRIs to evaluate the sensitivity of the ultrasound         imaging will include only participants with a single fibroid found at the early pregnancy         ultrasound.

In addition, we will assess aspects of       mother/child interaction. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       To evaluate the study, we employed a randomized controlled design using a blocked       randomization procedure. In this procedure, single woman and women with a participating       father were randomized in equal numbers to the Family Spirit or the breast-feeding education       program.

Using BWHS study data and specific information on participants       neighborhoods, including street layout and the presence of sidewalks, this study will       determine if neighborhood environments influence the prevalence of obesity among African       American women.        This study will use already-collected data on physical activity and body mass index of BWHS       study participants who live in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago; there are no additional       study visits specifically for this study. A transportation and urban planning expert will       compile data regarding the pedestrian environment of neighborhoods in all three cities,       including the nature and density of land use, proximity to parks, presence of sidewalks,       speed and volume of traffic, and street structure. Census data regarding participants       socioeconomic status will also be collected.

Moreover beneficial effects of triiodthyronine supplementation are       investigated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Backround: A normal thyroid function is critical for metabolism, well-being and cognitive       function. It is now well accepted that primary subclinical hypothyroidism, characterized by       normal circulating thyroid hormones fT3 and fT4 and elevated TSH, should be treated to       improve reduced quality of life and abnormalities of lipid metabolism. In central       hypothyroidism CH the dose of replacement therapy aims to achieve normal thyroxin T4       concentrations as defined by appropriate reference populations. Adequate thyroxin treatment       is especially challenging, as T4 cannot be titrated according to endogenous TSH levels       because of the impaired hypothalamic-pituitary unit. The majority of untreated CH patients       show normal 40 % or elevated TSH levels 35 % while only a minority has reduced       concentrations 25 % {Faglia, 1979 #1}. These findings are explained by the lack of       pulsatile secretion and nocturnal TSH surge, which has been attributed to impaired       thyrotroph function in CH patients {Caron, 1986 #2}. Moreover, impaired biological activity       of TSH itself due to reduced glycosylation has been described in secondary hypothyroidism.        In a cross sectional study performed in patients with central hypothyroidism, we found       elevated cholesterol levels and increased ankle reflex time suggesting subtle       hypothyroidism, though fT3 and fT4 serum concentrations were within the normal range. The       average dose of thyroxin T4 applied in these patients with central hypothyroidism was 1.1       µg/kg bw, which is below the average dose recommended in primary hypothyroidism 1.6 µg/kg       bw. We hypothesized that these results might indicate suboptimal T4 replacement therapy,       not detectable by current laboratory testing.        Hypothesis: To investigate the effects of a body weight adjusted T4 or T3T4 dose on       metabolism, well-being and cognitive function.        Study design: Placebo controlled trial in patients with central hypothyroidism following a       double blind cross-over design.        Intervention: Three different treatment regimes 5 weeks each were compared: CON-T4,       empirically chosen, current dose of T4 1 ± 0.05 μg/kg body weight bw; OPT-T4, optimized       T4 treatment 1.6 μg/kg bw T4; T3T4, combination of triiodothyronine T3, 0.16 and T4       1.44 μg/kg bw. Biochemical parameters, ankle reflex time and neurocognitive functions were       assessed.

SUMMARY:       The overall aim of the project is to evaluate diagnosis and treatment of chest pain       originating from the musculoskeletal system. Specifically, we wish to investigate prevalence       and character of such chest pain in a population of patients with acute chest pain, admitted       to a university hospital based acute chest pain clinic, and undergoing evaluation of acute       coronary syndrome Part 1. Then, to test a manually-based treatment protocol to patients       with diagnosed musculoskeletal chest pain in a randomized clinical trial Part 2.        The specific purpose of this study Part 1 is to determine the exact number of patients       with acute chest pain origination from the musculoskeletal system, and to describe their       cardiac status with respect to ischemic heart disease. Further, we wish to evaluate the       decision making process of the chiropractor. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Acute chest pain is a common reason for hospital admission. The focus of diagnosis is of       course pain of cardiac origin including myocardial infarction and/or other ischemic heart       disease; however, in up to 50% of cases the aetiology may be non-cardiac. Differential       diagnoses include primarily pulmonary, gastrointestinal, psychosocial, or musculoskeletal       problems, and musculoskeletal problems may account for around 20% of the total number of       admissions in acute chest pain clinics. Thus the musculoskeletal system is a recognized       possible source of pain in patients with chest pain even though a confident diagnosis of       musculoskeletal chest pain can be difficult to establish since no gold standard exists to       verify this diagnosis.        Chest pain patients with normal coronary anatomy have an excellent prognosis for survival       and a future risk of cardiac morbidity similar to that reported in the background       population. However, about three quarters of patients with non-cardiac chest pain continue       to suffer from residual chest pain with large socio-economic consequences. Therefore, a       search for an alternative cause with related possibilities for treatment is warranted. Given       these perspectives, the general objective of the present work is to study the diagnosis of       chest pain originating from the musculoskeletal system of the cervical and thoracic spine,       and thorax in patients with chest pain of various origins, and to evaluate ischemic heart       disease status among patients with presumed musculoskeletal pain.        Evaluation:        Patients with musculoskeletal chest pain will be identified using a standardized examination       protocol comprised of a semi-structured interview, a general health examination, and a       specific manual examination of the muscles and joints of the neck, thoracic spine and       thorax. All patients will have a Myocardial Perfusion Imaging MPI performed and results       from the MPI will be compared with the musculoskeletal status. Specific important parameters       of the standardized examination protocol will be identified and the decision making process       of the chiropractor will be evaluated. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  Acute episode of chest pain of less than 7 days duration as primary reason for              admission to a chest pain clinic.            -  Admitted to a chest pain clinic, suspected of acute coronary infarction, but with a              negative diagnosis confirmed by normal coronary enzymes and normal ECG.            -  Pain arising from the thorax and/or neck.            -  Able to read and understand Danish.

As the most commonly identified genetic cause of obesity, PWS is often       confused with Early-onset Morbid Obesity EMO. Individuals with EMO show some signs of PWS,       but clinically do not have PWS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical       features and genetic basis of PWS and EMO, and to determine how these conditions affect a       person throughout a lifetime. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       PWS is a complex neurobehavioral syndrome. Clinical features include obesity, increased       appetite, low muscle tone, cognitive impairment, distinct behavioral features, hypogonadism,       and neonatal failure-to-thrive. It is the most commonly recognized genetic cause of obesity;       however, many obese children do not in fact have PWS. These individuals are therefore       diagnosed with EMO, a condition that shares features with PWS. The development of new       advances and strategies for treating PWS and EMO requires a thorough understanding of the       conditions at both the clinical and molecular levels. One goal of this study is to collect       long-term data on individuals with PWS and EMO in order to gain a better understanding of       the natural progression of the conditions, from the neonatal period well into adulthood.       Specific to PWS, this study will establish a genotype-phenotype correlation among the       different sub-types and will evaluate the effects of growth hormone treatment on disease       progression. Lastly, the study will compare PWS with EMO in terms of clinical features and       genetic basis.        Participation in this natural history study will entail an initial evaluation, followed by       yearly study visits until the age of 3 and then every 2 years thereafter. Each study visit       will last between 3 and 4 hours, and will include a physical exam including a DEXA scan to       determine body composition, psychological testing, an interview with the study physician,       and an evaluation of the participants diet history. In addition, blood tests will be       completed for genetic testing and photos will be taken to evaluate disease progression.       Cognitive and behavioral assessments will also be conducted and will last between 10 and 30       minutes.

SWISSI 1 therefore recruits       totally asymptomatic subjects older than 40 years of age without any history of CAD but one       cardiovascular risk factor with documented silent ischemia. Participants are randomized to       open antianginal drug therapy and risk factor control versus only risk factor management and       followed up for ≥ 10 years. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Although there is still controversy regarding why ischemic episodes are symptomatic in some       patients and completely asymptomatic in others, it is now widely accepted that silent       ischemia, like symptomatic episodes, negatively affects prognosis. Silent ischemia may occur       in totally asymptomatic patients without type I or with a history type II of an ischemic       cardiac event and coexists with symptomatic episodes in many patients type III. However,       there is a lack of data on the prognostic importance of silent ischemia in totally       asymptomatic subjects without history of coronary artery disease CAD, i.e. silent ischemia       type I, and, particularly, on a possible benefit of medical therapy in such patients.       Reasons lie in the difficulty to identify such patients and their expected low event rates       implying that large patient populations and/or long follow-up periods would be necessary to       come to definite conclusions.

Whether external       or internal cooling is superior in terms of prognosis or security remains unknown. The aim       of this study is to evaluate in a randomized trial the clinical and economical interests of       the endovascular cooling versus the conventional external cooling for the management of       hypothermia after cardiac arrest. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       According to international guidelines, mild therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for       resuscitated patients after experiencing cardiac arrest from cardiac origin: unconscious       adult patients with spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest should be cooled to 32-34°C       for 12-24 hours when the initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation or pulseless       ventricular tachycardia. Such cooling may also be beneficial for other rhythm or       in-hospital cardiac arrest.        External or internal cooling techniques can be used to initiate cooling within minutes to       hours. The two main randomized and positive studies dealing with the efficiency of       hypothermia after cardiac arrest have used external cooling systems. However, several animal       studies documented the importance of initiating hypothermia as soon as possible after       cardiac arrest. Intravascular cooling enables more rapid induction of hypothermia compared       with external cooling method after brain injury. Although several human studies have also       documented that intravascular cooling provides more precise control of core temperature than       external methods and although an endovascular method has been used safely in pilot studies       in those experiencing hypothermia after cardiac arrest, the superiority of such a cooling on       the prognosis after cardiac arrest remains unknown, as well as its cost efficiency.        The aim of this study is to evaluate in a randomized trial the potential clinical and       economical interests of the endovascular cooling versus the conventional external cooling       for the management of cardiac arrest from cardiac origin. With a clinical primary endpoint       survival without major neurological sequels, this study will also focus on important       secondary endpoints, as the burden of nurse work and the economical costs induced by these 2       different methods of cooling.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Typically, after brain damage due to a stroke, the affected arm is weak and suffering from       some of paralysis. As a result, adults with this condition are unable to move their impaired       arm well during their activities of daily living. Our research is focused on understanding       how best to improve the ability of the arm to move after brain damage due to a stroke.

Patients of at least 10 years of age, who presented to the Emergency Department of the       Singapore General Hospital with regular narrow complex tachycardia and an       electrocardiographicECG diagnosis of SVT that was not converted by vagal manoeuvres       Valsava manoeuvre or carotid sinus massage or both and who were in SVT at the time of       doctor attendance were included in the study.        The exclusion criteria were as follows:          -  Patients with signs of impaired cerebral perfusion e.g. altered mental state or acute            pulmonary oedema          -  Patients with a subsequent diagnosis of arrhythmias other than SVT i.e. sinus            tachycardia, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or idiopathic ventricular tachycardia            were excluded from the analysis if they were initially enrolled          -  Pregnancy by history urine pregnancy testing was not used to actively exclude the            condition in any of the female patients entered into the study.        Having selected the patients according to the criteria, they were randomly assigned into two       groups: one to receive calcium channel blockers and the other, Adenosine. Within the former       group, some were assigned randomly to receive Diltiazem and some to Verapamil.        Diltiazem was given at the dose of 2.5mg per minute 4ml per minute of a concentration of       0.625 mg/ml up to a maximum of 50 mg. The dose of Verapamil was 1mg per minute 4ml per       minute of a concentration of 0.25mg/ml up to a maximum of 20mg. Both were given as a slow       intravenous infusion using a Terumo infusion pump.        During intravenous infusion, the patient’s vital signs, viz. heart rate and systolic and       diastolic blood pressures, were monitored at two-minute intervals up to completion of       infusion or conversion from SVT, whichever was the earlier. At the time of conversion to       sinus rhythm, the infusion was stopped and the amount of drug infused was noted and       recorded.        Regarding the Adenosine group, all the patients were administered Adenosine as a rapid bolus       within 2 sec through an 18G IV cannula at an antecubital vein, followed by 10 ml saline       flush and elevation of the limb. Initially 6ml bolus was given rapidly, and if there was no       conversion of the SVT within 2 min, another 12 mg bolus was administered.        If SVT was not converted at the end of any of calcium channel blocker infusion, those       patients were then given intravenous Adenosine as described above. Similarly, those patients       who remained in SVT after first two initial boluses of Adenosine were again randomized to       receive either Verapamil or Diltiazem.        This allowed four orders of treatment as follows:          -  Verapamil infusion followed by Adenosine          -  Diltiazem infusion followed by Adenosine          -  Adenosine followed by Verapamil infusion          -  Adenosine followed by Diltiazem infusion        If the tachycardia was not converted at the end of the study protocol, patients were managed       either with synchronised electrical cardioversion if haemodynamically unstable or with       further pharmacotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician if vital signs were       stable.        Following the successful conversion, patients vital signs were closely monitored at 1 min       immediate post-conversion, 5,10, 15 min and finally 30 min of post-conversion. If they       remained stable, they were shifted to observation ward with continuous telemetric       monitoring. They were eventually discharged if there were no recurrence during the period of       observation and arranged a follow-up appointment at Arrhythmia Clinic one week later.       Patients with the recurrence of SVT during the two-hour observation period were managed at       the discretion of the treating physician.        Study end points were as follows:          -  Conversion to sinus rhythm          -  Withdrawal because of major adverse effects          -  Completion of trial protocol without termination of tachycardia        Data on the final analysis was obtained from follow-up records of Cardiology department as       well. The cost of medication used for each patient was also computed to understand the cost       aspects of different regimens. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  More than 10 years old            -  Electrocardiographic diagnosis of SVT            -  SVT not converted by the vagal manoeuvres          Exclusion Criteria:            -  Signs of impaired cerebral perfusion            -  Signs of pulmonary oedema            -  Subsequent diagnosis of other types of arrythmias rather than SVT            -  pregnancy by history ");

A single centre randomised double-blind sham surgery controlled clinical trial studied the       effects of elective laparoscopic appendectomy on postoperative pain perception in patients       with persistent or recurrent lower abdominal quadrant pain on abdominal pain at 6 months       postoperatively. Secondary outcome was the relation between clinical response and the       appendix’ histopathology. The analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Pain       scores were compared using a Fisher’s exact test. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Forty patients were randomised, 18 patients had a laparoscopic appendectomy and 22 patients       had a laparoscopic inspection only. The postoperative pain scores were significantly       different favouring appendix removal p < 0.01. Relative risk calculations indicated a 2.4       fold 95% CI: 1.3 – 4.0 greater chance of improving or becoming pain free after       laparoscopic appendectomy. The number needed to treat was 2.2 patients 95% CI: 1.5 – 6.5.       There was no significant relation between postoperative pain scores and histopathology       findings.        Conclusions Chronic or recurrent appendicitis is a realistic clinical entity that can be       treated successfully by elective appendectomy leading to significant pain reduction in       properly selected cases. Histopathology of the removed appendix does not contribute to the       diagnosis. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  Patients were eligible if they were between 15 and 45 years of age, and if they              suffered from chronic or recurrent right lower abdominal quadrant pain for more than              three months. They were to experience continuous pain, or should have endured at              least one pain attack in the month prior to inclusion.          Exclusion Criteria:            -  Exclusion criteria consisted of a history of chronic back pain, previous abdominal              surgery with the exception of diagnostic laparoscopies or a laparoscopic              sterilization, specific gastro-intestinal entities such as inflammatory bowel              disease and gynaecological disease all female patients consulted a gynaecologist.              Routine laboratory investigations included hemoglobin rate, serum leukocyte count and              differentiation, C-Reactive Protein concentration, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate,              faeces cultures and urine sedimentation. Barium contrast studies of the colon were              done in all patients, abdominal ultrasound or enteroclysis on discretion. Finally,              exclusion was possible when diagnostic laparoscopy revealed abnormalities see              below. ");
INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00418392","TITLE:       Intrapleural Minocycline After Simple Aspiration for the Prevention of Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax SUMMARY:       The estimated recurrence rate of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is 23-50% after the first       episode, and the optimal treatment remains unknown. In the recently published British       Thoracic Society BTS guidelines, simple aspiration is recommended as first line treatment       for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention. However, the 1 year recurrence rate       of this procedure was as high as 25-30%, making it inappropriate as a standard of care.        Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant chemical pleurodesis is an effective way       to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous       pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients. Many chemical irritants tetracycline,       talc, and minocycline have been used to decrease the rate of recurrence in spontaneous       pneumothorax. Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer       available. Talc insufflation of the pleural cavity is safe and effective for primary       spontaneous pneumothorax. However, it should be applied either with surgical or medical       thoracoscopy. Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in       inducing pleural fibrosis in rabbits. In the previous studies, we have shown that additional       minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure to decrease the rates of       ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In       the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in       patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to       test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background:        Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly occurs in young, tall, lean males 1, 2. The       estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode 3. Optimal treatment of       patients presenting with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains       unknown. In the recently published British Thoracic Society BTS guidelines 4, simple       aspiration is recommended as first line treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring       intervention. However, the 1 year recurrence rate of this procedure was as high as 26-30%       5, making it inappropriate as a standard of care.        Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant chemical pleurodesis is an effective way       to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous       pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients 6, 7. Light et al. has shown that       intrapleural tetracycline is effective in reducing the rate of ipsilateral recurrence for       patients with spontaneous pneumothorax 7. However, the recently published guidelines       recommended that chemical pleurodesis should only be attempted if the patient is either       unwilling or unable to undergo surgery because the rates of recurrence of pneumothoraces       after surgical intervention either by thoracotomy or VATS, with or without surgical       pleurodesis, is far less than after chemical pleurodesis 4, 8. As a result, chemical       pleurodesis has rarely been used in primary spontaneous pneumothorax, and the effect of       additional chemical pleurodesis after simple aspiration in preventing recurrence of       pneumothoraces has never been evaluated.        Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer available.       Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in inducing       pleural fibrosis in rabbits 9. In the previous studies, we have shown that additional       minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure that associates with lower rates       of prolonged air leaks and ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary       spontaneous pneumothorax 10, 11.        In the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in       patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to       test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence. This study will comply with the protocol, GCP       and applicable requirement of the Institutional Review Boards IRB of the NTUH and Far       Eastern Memorial Hospital.        Patients and Methods:        Study design This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate if       additional minocycline pleurodesis after simple aspiration will be effective in preventing       recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.        Primary Objective The primary end point is to compare the rates of ipsilateral recurrence       between the minocycline and observation groups after simple aspiration of the pneumothorax.        Secondary Objectives          1. Safety profile of minocycline pleurodesis          2. Early results, including immediate success rates, one-week success rates, complication            rates, rates of hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, and the degrees of chest            pain.          3. Long-term effects of minocycline pleurodesis, including degrees of residual chest pain            and pulmonary function test.

Subjects who are unwilling to undergo                 randomization, treatment, or follow-up procedures will be removed from the study.                 Subjects can also withdraw from the trial at any time point by their will.        Randomization:        Patients will be randomized at each center with separate random number lists into one of the       two treatment groups using a computer-generated table numerically corresponding with the       treatment group. The trial treatment randomization codes will be maintained until the end of       the study and will be broken by investigators who were blind to the randomization procedure.        Manual aspiration Manual aspiration will be performed as follows: patients were seated in       semi-supine position. After skin disinfection and field preparation, a small-caliber       pig-tail catheter 6-10 French will be introduced after local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine       in the second intercostal space, at the midclavicular line. After the catheter enters the       pleural space, the catheter will be fixed to the skin using sterile adhesive tape and       connected via a three-way valve to a 50-ml syringe. Air will be manually aspirated, until a       resistance was felt and air was no longer aspirated. Thereafter, a chest X-ray will be       performed with the catheter in place.        Minocycline pleurodesis In the minocycline group, 30 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride       300mg followed by a solution of 30 mL of normal saline containing 300 mg of minocycline       Mirosin®, Taiwan Panbiotic Laboratories, Kaohsiung, Taiwan will be instilled into the       pleural cavity through the pig-tail catheter or chest tube. In the observation group,       nothing will be administered. Administration of other chemical pleurodesis agents is       prohibited during the study period. Intramuscular meperidine hydrochloride Demerol®,       50mg/ampule will be administered every 4 to 6 hours according to the patients request if       the pain became intolerable, could not be relieved by oral analgesics, and visual analogue       scale was greater than 7. Chest radiography will be performed immediate postoperatively or       the next morning. VAS will be evaluated immediately 6 hours later after minocycline       administration.        Study Endpoints:        The primary end point will be rate of ipsilateral recurrence after the procedure. Secondary       end points include safety, early results, and long-term effects of minocycline pleurodesis.        Immediate success rates: defined as complete or nearly complete and persistent lung       expansion immediately following manual aspiration. Immediate success for chest tube drainage       is defined as complete lung expansion, absence of air leakage, and chest drain removal       within 24 hours after catheter placement.        One weeks success rates are defined as complete and persistent lung expansion at one weeks       after the first attempt of aspiration or tube insertion.        One-year success: absence of recurrent pneumothorax during a 1-year follow-up period. .        Safety assessments:        Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all toxicity, adverse events,       safety laboratory examination, vital signs, physical examination. The adverse events which       are not reported will be graded as mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening. Adverse       event will be tabulated and the incidence rates will be calculated.        Sample size estimation:        A sample size of 300 patients 150 in each group will be needed to reach clinical       significance at the .05 level with a power of 0.9 if minocycline reduced the recurrence       rate from 30% to 15% and the drop out rate is 10%. A planned interim analysis will be       conducted after enrollment of 150 patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Statistical       analysis will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis rather than in an actual treatment       basis.        Follow-up After discharge from the hospital, patients will be followed at the outpatient       clinics at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months where chest radiography will be       performed. Follow-ups will then be conducted every 6 months by a registered nurse who is       blinded to the group allocation by telephone conversation, according to a standard       questionnaire that included when the patient returns to work or school, whether a recurrence       occurred, when it happened, and how it is treated. Residual postoperative chest pain will be       evaluated on a pain score from 0 to 5, where 0 is pain free; 1 is occasional discomfort; 2       is occasional use of analgesics; 3 is using nonopiate analgesics; 4 is regular pain using       opiates; 5 is severe and intractable pain. All patients will be followed for at least 12       months. Patients can come back to the clinic or visit emergency department whenever they       have chest pain, dyspnea, or any signs related to the recurrence of pneumothorax.        Pulmonary function analysis Pulmonary function tests will be performed for patients able to       attend a hospital outpatient appointment at least 6 months after surgery. Forced vital       capacity FVC and forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1.0 will be measured using a       spirometer of Microspiro HI-298 Chest Corporation, Tokyo, Japan with the patients seated.       A minimum of three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers will be performed and the best one       will be selected for analysis.        Data collection and statistical analysis The clinical data, duration of chest drainage,       length of hospital stay, complications, requested doses of meperidine, and data of VAS will       be collected. Continuous variables such as age or weight will be expressed as the mean +       standard deviation and analyzed by the two sample t-test. Categorical variables such as       gender or smoking status will be presented by frequency % and analyzed by the Fishers       exact test. Intensity of postoperative pain measured by VAS from 0 to 10 were summarized       by mean 95 percent confidence interval and compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Scores of       residual chest pain will be analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Freedom from recurrence       will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons will be made by the log-rank       test.        Reference:          1.

Typically, post-traumatic epilepsy PTE       develops or several weeks but even years after the event. PTE is often chronic and poorly       controlled pharmacologically. Although several factors have been attributed to an increased       risk of developing PTE e.g. severity of trauma, type of brain injury, time to the       appearance of first seizure, the mechanisms underlying it remain unknown. Similar to TBI,       ischemic injuries, most frequently occurring in the elderly population are the main cause of       new onset epilepsy in this age group. It is still not known what are the risk factors and       mechanisms underlying post-ischemic epilepsy.        Under normal conditions the central nervous system is protected by the operation of the       blood- brain barrier BBB. Following brain injury either traumatic or ischemic the BBB is       known to disrupt, leading to focal edema and altered extracellular composition. We have       recently established methods for quantitative evaluation of the integrity of the BBB using       magnetic resonance imaging MRI brain scans. Using these methods we are able to identify       BBB disruption in patients suffering from various pathologies Tomkins, O. et al. 2001;       Avivi, E. et al. 2004. Such altered permeability may last up to years following the acute       event and was found to correlate to areas of abnormal neurological function Korn, A. et al.       2005        In recent work using an animal model, we have shown that following focal disruption of the       BBB a focus of epileptiform activity is generated within several days. Such pathological       activity remains for several weeks, long after the BBB has retained its former function       Seiffert, E. et al. 2004; Iven, S. et al. 2006. Furthermore, this condition may later lead       to anatomical alterations as seen by brain MRI scans, as well as in histological sections.       Such animals further suffer from functional deterioration and neuronal degeneration in the       disrupted region Tomkins, O. et al. 2006.        In this work we will test the hypothesis that BBB disruption following brain injury       increases the risk for long-term disability, development of brain dysfunction, epileptic       seizures and neuroanatomical alterations. For that we will combine a prospective and       retrospective study in patients following cerebral cortical injury traumatic, hemorrhagic       or ischemic. Clinical, functional and anatomical measures will be obtained in addition to       BBB permeability measures.

Therefore, the management of patients with a       normal clinical examination after blunt trauma is a subject of controversy. Since 1970s,       computer tomography CT has become the mainstay of evaluating hemodynamically stable trauma       patients. Its generally accepted that hemodynamically stable patient with abnormal       abdominal examination results require the use of CT as well as patients with depressed level       of consciousness. Controversy exists with the awake, clinically evaluable patients with no       obvious signs of abdominal and chest trauma. In the last years number of studies express CT       role in evaluation of asymptomatic trauma patient with mechanism of injury supporting       probability of internal organs injury. Those studies show that in a large number of patients       the management was changed according to CT results. The authors recommended liberal use of       CT in trauma patient population. All those studies have been performed in adult trauma       patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of whole body imaging in       pediatric patients with suspicious mechanism of injury, which are hemodynamically stable and       has no obvious signs of chest and abdominal injury. The incidence of injury in these patient       population as well as changes in treatment based on results of CT will be examined. Methods       The prospective observational study will be performed in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Dementia is a syndrome caused by diseases of the cerebral parenchyma, and it is a state in       which cognitive functions, including attention, memory, thinking, comprehension, judgment,       and computation, are diminished. Because of the mental symptoms, problem behaviors, and       decreased activities of daily living ADL it is also recognized as a major social problem.       However, rehabilitation of elderly people with dementia is still at the trial-and-error       stage, and establishing a method of rehabilitation is an urgent task. In 2004, the authors       devised and created a training method that integrates exercise therapy with feedback therapy       to treat the cognitive dysfunction of elderly people with dementia. To do so the authors       introduced speed-feedback therapy with a bicycle ergometer as a feedback therapy       intervention. The results of a preliminary study of the efficacy of this method in improving       cognitive dysfunction in 17 elderly persons with dementia showed improvement in cognitive       dysfunction, and their attentiveness also improved, suggesting that the impaired       attentiveness may have improved in response to treatment by this method and, as a result,       have led to improvement of cognitive dysfunction. However, it became clear that it would be       necessary to further improve and develop the system, and to demonstrate its efficacy in a       controlled trial and verify associations between improvement of cognitive dysfunction and       improvement of the ADL of dementia patients and their quality of life QOL.

Active approaches are directed       towards diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening conditions, especially acute       coronary syndrome and coronary artery disease. However, a considerable number of patients       may have chest pain caused by biomechanical dysfunction of muscles and joints of the chest       wall or the cervical and thoracic spine 20%. The diagnostic approaches and treatment       options for this group of patients are scarce and there is a lack of formal clinical studies       and validated outcome measures addressing the effect of manual treatment approaches.        Objective: This single blind randomized clinical trial investigates whether chiropractic       treatment can reduce pain and improve function in a population of patients with acute,       musculoskeletal chest pain when compared to advice directed towards promoting       self-management.        Methods: Among patients admitted to a chest pain clinic in a university hospital under       suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, 120 patients with an episode of acute chest pain of       musculoskeletal origin are included in the study. All patients have completed the chest pain       clinic diagnostic procedures, and acute coronary syndrome and other obvious reasons for       chest pain have been excluded. After completion of the study evaluation program, the       patients are randomized into one of two groups: A advice promoting self-management and       individual instructions focusing on posture and muscle stretch; B a course of chiropractic       therapy of up to ten treatment sessions focusing on high velocity, low amplitude       manipulation of the cervical and thoracic spine together with a choice of mobilisation and       soft tissue techniques. In order to establish suitable outcome measures, two pilot studies       were conducted. Outcome measures are pain, function, overall health, and patient-rated       treatment effect measured at 4, 12, and 52 weeks following treatment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND        Acute chest pain is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission.Bechgaard, 1982       In Denmark alone, more than 30,000 patients are admitted to medical departments because of       chest pain.Fruergaard, 1992 In the United States chest pain is the reason for 20-30       percent of all acute medical hospital admissions.Capewell, 2000 However, an estimated 5-20       percent of all admissions to acute chest pain departments are caused by chest pain of       musculoskeletal origin.Knockaert 2002; Spalding 2003; Fruergaard 1996        Chest pain patients with normal coronary anatomy have an excellent prognosis for survival       and a future risk of cardiac morbidity similar to that reported in the background       population.Berman 1999; Klocke 2003 However, about three quarters of patients with       non-cardiac chest pain continue to suffer from residual chest pain with large socio-economic       consequences.Spalding 2003; Launbjerg 1997; Ockene 1980; Eslick 2002; Tew 1995; Wielgosz       1984; Achem 2000        An extensive body of literature addresses patient management protocols for patients       presenting with chest pain primarily focusing on cardiopulmonary, gastroesophageal, and       psychological conditions causing chest symptoms, but treatment protocols of musculoskeletal       chest pain remain, however, scarce. Neither the effect of medical treatment oral       anti-inflammatory drug, exercise strength and/or stretching, nor advice have been       investigated. In particular, there is a lack of formal clinical studies examining the       effectiveness of manual/manipulative approaches to manage musculoskeletal chest pain. To the       best of the authors knowledge, only one study exists that deal with this       aspect.Christensen, 2005        Therefore, the aim of this single-blind randomized clinical trial is to compare the effect       of chiropractic treatment versus advice directed towards promoting self-management in a       population of patients with musculoskeletal chest pain using standardized outcome measures.       Further, a cost-effectiveness analysis along side the RCT will be performed.        METHODS        Design: Single-blinded Randomized Trial.        Study sample:        The patients are recruited from a university hospital chest pain clinic. The chest pain       clinic is part of a large specialized cardiology department. All patients undergo a       standardized evaluation program ruling out acute coronary syndrome and any other obvious and       significant cardiac or non-cardiac disease. Sixty patients are to be included in each of the       two intervention groups, totaling 120 participants. The patients are included as a part of a       larger study on diagnosis of musculoskeletal chest pain.        Examination and baseline data:        Following discharge from the chest pain clinic, all patient records are screened for the       inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, and potential participants are invited to participate.       Within 7 days, participants are assessed in an individual baseline test. First, they       complete a battery of questionnaires including information on social, occupation, education,       physical and lifestyle factors, expectation to treatment outcome, and baseline values for       the outcome measure see below. Signed consent forms are obtained from all participants.        Next, patients with musculoskeletal chest pain will be identified using a standardized       examination protocol. The examination protocol consists of 3 parts: 1 a semi-structured       interview including pain characteristics, symptoms from the lungs and gastrointestinal       system, the past medical history, height and weight, and risk factors of ischemic heart       disease, 2 a general health examination including blood pressure and pulse, heart and       lung stethoscopy, abdominal palpation, neck auscultation, and clinical signs of left       ventricular failure, neurological examination of upper and lower extremities in terms of       reflexes, sensibility to touch, muscle strength, as well as orthopaedic examination of the       neck and shoulder joints in order to rule out nerve root compression syndromes., and 3 a       specific manual examination of the muscles and joints of the neck, thoracic spine and thorax       including active range of motion, manual palpation for muscular tenderness on 14 point of       the anterior chest wall, palpation for paraspinal muscular tenderness segmentally, motion       palpation for joint-play restriction of the thoracic spine Th1-8, and end play restriction       of the cervical and thoracic spine.        The examination program together with the detailed case history will be applied by the       clinician to the population of chest pain patients to make a diagnosis of pain from the       musculoskeletal system, Cervico-thoracic Angina CTA.        Randomization:        Only CTA positive participants draw a sealed, opaque envelope numbered in succession and       containing information about treatment allocation. The randomization sequence is computer       generated. The envelopes are arranged in clusters of varying size. The examining clinician       manages the hand over of the envelope to the participant, but is blind to treatment       allocation.        Interventions:        CTA positive participants will be randomized to receive advice promoting self-management       advice group or a standard course of chiropractic treatment therapy group.        Advice group: Advice is directed towards promoting self-management. The participants are       told that their chest pain generally has a benign, self limiting course. The participants       receive individual instructions regarding posture and two or three exercises aiming to       increase spinal or muscle stretch based on clinical evaluation. They are advised to seek       medical attention for re-evaluation general physician, chest pain clinic or emergency       department in case of severe or unfamiliar chest pain. The session lasts on average 15       minutes. Further, the advice group is also asked not to seek any manual treatment for the       next four weeks.        Therapy group: Participants in the therapy group undergo a physical examination by an       experienced, primary sector chiropractor, lasting up to one hour. The chiropractors choose       an individual treatment strategy based on a combination of their findings, the patient       history, and a standardized protocol reflecting routine practice. The standardized treatment       protocol includes high velocity, low amplitude manipulation directed towards the thoracic       and/or cervical spine in combination with any of the following: Joint mobilization, soft       tissue techniques, stretching, stabilizing or strengthening exercises, heat or cold       treatment, and advice. The protocol specifies up to ten treatment sessions of approximately       20 minutes, 1-3 times per week, or treatment until the patient is pain free. The       chiropractors record the types of treatment rendered at sessions.        Follow-up: Follow-up data are collected at four weeks, 3 months and one year Figure 1        Data analyzes: Data will be analyzed by a research group member blinded to group status. The       analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle. Both parametric and non       parametric principle will be used to compare treatment effects between the groups and to       identify baseline predictors for successful treatment outcome. Finally, based on a prior       definition of success, numbers needed to treat will be calculated.        Cost-effectiveness analysis: A cost comparison of the therapy and advice group will be       performed using data on direct and indirect costs. A cost-utility analysis comparing the       therapy and advice group will be performed using the EuroQol 5D.

Small electrical impulses are used to excite/stimulate the       nerves that supply paralyzed muscles. This activates those muscles, enabling them to produce       basic but useful movement. Self-adhesive patches electrodes are placed on the skin close       to the nerve that supplies the muscle and are connected by wires to a stimulator that       produces the impulses. In this way, FES is used to correct the muscle weakness that is       caused by injury to the brain or spinal cord.        Repetitive task practice is an activity-based therapy program that has been shown to       enhance the recovery of hand and arm functions after stroke. This therapy consists of a set       of training activities that are designed by a qualified therapist specific to your       functional abilities that are to be performed with the impaired hand. These activities are       designed to stimulate functional improvement with repetitive practice.        Spasticity is a nervous system disorder where certain muscles are continuously contracted.       Botox injections are commonly used to help to reduce spasticity in areas of the body with       increased muscle tone. This research is designed to look at any additional benefit that may       occur when Botox injections are combined with specific occupational therapy exercises and       with a device that uses functional electrical stimulation FES to help improve muscle       function after stroke. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial examining the effect of repetitive       task practice RTP and functional electrical stimulation FES in individuals who receive       routine clinical Botox ® injections for upper extremity spasticity. Botox® injections in       combination with repetitive task practice RTP is used routinely to manage upper limb       spasticity after stroke or acquired brain injury. RTP is an activity-based rehabilitation       program that has been shown effective in promoting motor recovery Wolf et al., 2002, but       it requires a sufficient level of baseline motor function. Since FES enhances motor       function, we hypothesize that an FES-assisted RTP intervention will provide greater       improvement in hand function than RTP alone in patients receiving Botox ® injections.        The primary outcome will be upper extremity use during activities of daily living assessed       observationally by the motor activities log MAL-O. Secondary outcomes will be 1 dexterous       hand function as measured by the action research arm test ARAT; 2 clients perception of       self-performance in activities of daily living assessed with the MAL - Self Report; 3       global upper extremity impairment assessed by the Chedoke-McMaster Assessment CMA; and 4       clinical spasticity assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale MAS.        The primary endpoint will be 6 weeks post-injection. Outcomes will also be assessed at a       secondary endpoint, 12 weeks post-injection, to determine the persistence of treatment       effects. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  Minimum 6 months post injury/insult with unilateral upper limb spasticity of the              elbow, wrist and/or finger flexors.            -  Preinjection Modified Ashworth scores > 2 in at least one of the following areas:              elbow, wrist, or finger flexors.            -  Subjects must meet criteria for CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 2 and be able to              complete Task 3 thumb to index finger of the CMA Hand Impairment Scale Stage 3, or              demonstrate 50% gross grasp to be included.            -  Botulinum toxin A Botox® stable patients have received at least two prior doses of              the agent with first dose occurring at least 6 months prior to study enrollment.            -  Able to answer reliably to yes/no questions.            -  Able to follow reliably 1-step instructions.            -  Written informed consent.            -  Females enrolled in this study who are of childbearing age will be required to use              adequate measures of birth control for the entire study period.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Critical limb ischemia CLI is a serious condition that is becoming more and more common in       the western world due to the growing percentage of elderly in the population and the rising       incidence of diabetes. In about 40% of patients a stenosis or occlusion in the arteries       below the level of the knee will be present. Restoration of blood flow is imperative to       allow pain relief and tissue healing. Without revascularization patients with CLI are at       risk for limb loss and potentially fatal complications such as sepsis.        In patients treated with percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty PTAsignificant       restenosis is found in approximately 50% after 6 months.        In interventional cardiology a significant reduction in restenosis rates in coronary       arteries has been found using drug eluting stents DES, including the paclitaxel eluting       stent TAXUS, Boston Scientific. DES locally deliver drugs e.g. paclitaxel that interfere       with the restenosis process.        Using DES in treating below the knee infrapopliteal arterial lesions in patients with CLI       may improve patency and clinical outcome.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00479908","TITLE:       Blood Pressure Interaction Between Sildenafil and Sublingual Glyceryl Trinitrate GTN in Men With Angina SUMMARY:       The purpose of the study is to determine for how long sildenafil potentiates the blood       pressure reduction that occurs with glyceryl trinitrate in men with angina. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       By producing a mediator known as cGMP, nitric oxide NO potently dilates blood vessels.       Nitrates, such as glyceryl trinitrate GTN, are drugs that release NO NO donors and are       widely used in the treatment and prevention of angina. Sildenafil is an effective treatment       for male penile erectile dysfunction that inhibits the breakdown cGMP. When given alone it       causes modest reductions in BP in healthy people and patients with cardiovascular disease.       By their synergistic actions, co-administration of NO donors with sildenafil can result in       large reductions in BP in patients with angina, a population at increased risk of developing       erectile dysfunction. As a result, it is recommended that the two drugs not be       co-administered within 24 hours of one another.        Previous studies have defined the effect of nitrates at 60 min after administration of       sildenafil, the time of likely maximum interaction. However, emergency medicine physicians       would value evidence of a balance of risks from which to make a personal clinical judgement       about when they might consider giving GTN in a patient presenting with a severe episode of       angina who has recently received sildenafil. Evidence on which to base such a judgement is       currently not available. However, we have recently completed a study, showing that the       interaction of GTN 0.4 mg spray after sildenafil 100 mg lasts less than 4 hours in       healthy subjects. Whilst the findings would probably be similar for patients with angina,       this question now needs to be investigated directly in order to ensure the generalisability       of this work and address an important unresolved clinical issue.        Subjects will be asked to refrain from using short-acting nitrates for 24 hours and long       acting nitrates for 72 hours before the start of the study. On the morning of each study       visit subjects will take their normal medications, including anti-anginals, as soon as they       wake up at home. They will also eat a light breakfast at home before coming to the research       unit.        Subjects will attend 4 study visits, each separated by at least 5 days. At study visit 1 GTN       will be administered 4 and 8 hours after oral sildenafil or matched placebo. At visit 2 GTN       will be administered 4 and 8 hours after the alternative treatment sildenafil or placebo.       The order in which sildenafil and placebo are given will be randomised. At study visit 3 GTN       will be administered 1 and 6 hours after sildenafil or placebo. Finally, at visit 4 GTN will       be administered 1 and 6 hours after the alternative treatment sildenafil or placebo. As       with visits 1 and 2, the order in which sildenafil and placebo are given will be randomised.        Regular single measures of sitting and standing after 2 min standing BP and heart rate       HR will be recorded at baseline and before and for 40 minutes after each GTN       administration. Venous blood samples 20 mL will be taken at baseline and immediately       before and 40 min after each GTN administration for later determination of plasma       concentrations of sildenafil and its active metabolite, UK-103,320.

We hypothesize that       the use of a cholinesterase inhibitor for two weeks will be associated with improvement in       safe driving behavior on a simulated driving task. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Alzheimers disease AD is the most common cause of dementia, and while it is known that AD       poses substantial risks of motor vehicle collisions, many people in the earliest stages of       AD continue to drive. Memory problems themselves are poor predictors of who is actually       unsafe on the road, and various medications that are used to treat people with AD may impact       on their driving abilities. Donepezil is a drug used to treat the memory problems associated       with AD. While previous studies have shown that it slows the decline of activities of daily       living eg. shopping, banking, dressing and may improve the ability of younger pilots to       perform on computerized flight simulators, no studies have examined the impact of donepezil       on driving abilities in older adults.        The present investigation is a pilot study aiming to determine if donepezil helps healthy       older drivers perform on driving simulators. Two Canadian academic centers have different       driving simulators - one in Toronto and one in Thunder Bay. At each of these centers, ten       healthy men aged 65 to 75 will be randomly assigned to receive either donepezil 5mg/day or       identical placebo for two weeks.        Using the driving simulator, we will assess various aspects of driving ability. These       measures of driving performance will be compared between those who received the drug and       those who received the placebo.

To determine the proportion of patients who experience partial or complete recollection            of symptoms of delirium and the level of distress associated with this recall.          2. To determine caregivers level of distress associated with the patients episode of            delirium. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Informed Consent for Patients:        Delirium is often seen in patients with advanced cancer. Delirium is defined as confusion       and restlessness. In this study, cancer patients will be asked about their memory of       experiencing delirium and the distress related to those memories. Caregivers of those       patients will also be asked to participate, and they will be asked questions about their       experience during these situations.        You will be tested using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale to see if you have recovered       from your delirium. If you are still eligible to take part in this study, and both you and       your caregiver agree to participate in this study; you will be asked by the research nurse       to complete several questionnaires that ask questions about your mental state, any memory of       experiencing delirium, the severity of the delirium, symptoms you experienced during the       delirium episode, and your level of emotional distress related to that event. If you and       your caregiver are asked to participate in this study; you will also be asked open-ended       questions questions with no wrong answers regarding the experience you had during the       severe episode of delirium; your memories of the experience, and the overall distress       related to it. This conversation will be tape recorded, and it will be written down       word-for-word, for the purpose of analysis. The conversation is expected to last no more       than 30 minutes.

Carotid artery stenting CAS recently has become an accepted method for       treatment of patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis, who are at an increased risk       for surgical carotid endarterectomy CEA. The reported rates of neurological complications       of CAS substantially decreased during the past years, and the routine use of cerebral       protection devices and low profile catheter systems have further increased the procedure´s       safety. In the early 90s large surgical trials in North America and Europe NASCET, ECST       and ACAS demonstrated superiority of CEA compared to best medical treatment for symptomatic       and asymptomatic patients. Provided that the ongoing randomized controlled trials comparing       CAS and CEA confirm equivalence between the these methods, CAS similar to CEA is applicable       to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with high grade carotid stenosis. However,       particularly in asymptomatic patients, the indication for revascularisation remains       debatable. Protected CAS is associated with a very low rate of neurological complications,       which are below the AHA recommendation for treating asymptomatic patients 3%. However, the       introduction of new vascular protective medications like statins and clopidogrel during the       recent years substantially improved the spectrum of best medical treatment, and the findings       of NASCET, ECST and ACAS with respect to best medical treatment may therefore not be       applicable any more.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00512655","TITLE:       Trial to Reduce Falls Incidence Rate in Frail Elderly SUMMARY:       Background: Approximately 750,000 elderly Dutch people fall at least once a year, which       often results in physical injuries and a fear of falling, with high costs and far-reaching       consequences on functionality, physical activity, quality of life and mental well-being.       Falling is not only a burden for patients, it is also a burden for their caregivers.       Recurrent falling is a complex problem. However, the pathophysiological background of falls,       gait problems and dementia is largely unknown. The general pathophysiological hallmark of       aging is a liability in homeostatic mechanisms of organs. This liability results in an       impaired ability to adapt to stress and in increased biological variation in outcome       measures within individuals. In this study the investigators aim at developing an       intervention to reduce recurrent falling in frail elderly fallers.        Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that the intervention program will decrease the       number of falls and fear of falling and increase mental well-being, physical activity and       functional performance in frail elderly people with a history of recurrent falling. In       addition, the burden on the caregivers will be reduced due to the intervention and will be       cost-effective. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that patients with a high       short-term intra-individual biological variability in gait and cognition variables have a       higher risk of falling, worse gait performance and cognitive decline after long term       follow-up.        Study Design: Randomized, controlled, single-blind trial.        Study Population: 160 patients referred to a geriatric outpatient clinic, who fell at least       once in the last 6 months and their primary caregivers N=160.        Intervention: A multifaceted fall prevention program for frail elders to reduce falls       incidence rate, consisting of physical and cognitive components. Moreover, it includes a       training program for caregivers in which they learn to support and give advice to the       patients, aiming to decrease the burden on the caregivers.        Primary Outcome Measures: The fall incidence rate is the primary outcome measure. Total       observation time of falls will be 6 months after the start of the intervention.        Secondary Outcome Measures: In the patients, the secondary outcome measures are fear of       falling FES, quality of life MOS-20, depression and general anxiety, functional       performance in activities of daily living, physical activity, mobility, gait parameters,       body sway and biomarkers of endothelial function and frailty. For the caregiver, the       secondary outcome measures are caregivers burden, mood and quality of life. In addition,       intraindividual variability of cognition, balance and gait in both patients and caregivers,       will be assessed and cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be determined. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Nature and Extent of the Burden and Risks Associated with Participation, Benefit and Group       Relatedness: The outcome of this study may have important reflections on protocols to       prevent falling among elders and on health care decision makers to stimulate starting new       fall clinics and implement these protocols. Through this study, the well-being and       functionality of frail elders and their caregivers could be improved. As falling has an       enormous economic burden, a new effective fall prevention intervention could reduce health       care costs substantially. The tests consisting of questionnaires and gait and balance       measurement are non-invasive and safe. Taking blood samples is an invasive procedure,       although no serious adverse effects are expected. There are no foreseeable risks associated       with participation in this study.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Achieving hemostasis at the arterial puncture site after percutaneous cardiac       catheterization is a potential cause of bleeding, hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, and various       other vascular complications. Hemostasis at the femoral artery access site after diagnostic       or interventional procedures is typically achieved using either manual compression or the       deployment of a vascular closure device. Manual compression is time consuming for the       health-care provider, and painful for the patient. In addition, prolonged periods of       immobilization and bed rest may be required. Vascular closure devices have been developed to       avoid manual compression, shorten bed rest, and allow earlier ambulation.        The Ensure Medical Vascular Closure device VCD is intended for femoral artery puncture       site closure in patients who have undergone coronary catheterizations using a standard 7F       introducer sheath. The device is comprised of a bio-absorbable plug and a plug delivery       system. The plug delivery system is designed to position the bio-absorbable plug to the       extravascular surface of the femoral artery access site, facilitating a hemostasis response.       The Ensure Medical VCD has been studied in a prior feasibility trial of 149 patients       utilizing a 6F introducer sheath, which demonstrated that: 1 the device could be used to       successfully obtain rapid hemostasis and early ambulation in patients undergoing       catheterization procedures; and 2 the low incidence and relatively minor nature of the       observed closure related complications suggests that the device is safe for its intended       purpose.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Increasingly, emergency department patients for whom a non-ischemic etiology of ACS symptoms       cannot be identified undergo further evaluation to rule out myocardial ischemia and       appraisal of cardiovascular risk factors CRFs in chest pain observation units CPOUs.       CPOU admission may represent a teachable moment, but there has been little research on the       effectiveness of brief, practical interventions for cardiovascular risk reduction in this       population, despite the fact that the vast majority of these patients have at least one       modifiable CRF and many do not receive regular primary care follow-up. The purpose of this       study is to determine whether a brief counseling intervention initiated in the CPOU has a       significant impact upon health attitudes readiness to change and cardiovascular       risk-related behaviors diet, exercise, and smoking. Based on the Health Belief Model       HBM, the intervention is designed to provide patients with tailored information on their       cardiovascular risk, to negotiate goals for change, and to build problem-solving skills. All       participants who are admitted to the CPOU for evaluation of ACS symptoms will be randomized       to brief intervention face-to-face counseling in the CPOU, coupled with telephone       counseling at 4 weeks or to minimal intervention booklet with general information on CRFs       after a negative initial troponin measurement. We will conduct a baseline survey and       follow-up telephone interviews at 2- and 6-month to assess stage of change and CRF-related       behaviors. Both adjusted and unadjusted multivariable analyses will be performed to       determine the intervention effect using an intention-to-treat approach. We will also use       mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which the intervention is mediated by HBM       constructs e.g., perceived susceptibility to cardiovascular adverse events, perceived       benefit of risk reduction, perceived barriers, self-efficacy. The proposed trial will       evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of delivering brief interventions for       cardiovascular risk reduction in the CPOU setting, will provide insight into mechanisms of       behavior change in these patients, and will guide the development of future case management       interventions.

Injections will be targeted to reduce common       spasticity patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent       wrist, thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities. This will be done only at       Emory University. Neither the doctor injecting the drug nor the subject receiving the drug       will know if they are getting BOTOX® or saline. Which type of injection the subject receives       will be completely randomized like flipping a coin. All subjects will have rehabilitation       therapy after their injections. Subjects will be assessed at a total of 5 scheduled visits       qualification Week 1, Injection Week 2, Evaluations on Weeks 8, 10, and 14. All       subjects will receive rehabilitation therapy immediately after their injections for 1 hour a       day, 3-5 times a week, for 4 weeks. The results from this project will provide valuable data       on the ability of BOTOX® and physical rehabilitation to provide effective treatment to       spastic muscles of the arm and hand after stroke. This project has the potential to increase       the availability of effective rehabilitation techniques to patients with stroke. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       After a stroke, patients commonly experience tightness in their affected arm from wrist and       hand muscle overactivity called spasticity. Spasticity is difficult to manage with only one       type of treatment. Usual treatments of spasticity are not very effective and may produce       unwanted side effects. Untreated spasticity may result in muscular problems and decrease a       patients general ability to function and thus affect his/her quality of life.        BOTOX®, a botulinum toxin type A produced from Clostridium botulinum, blocks certain       chemicals that cause spasticity. With appropriate injections of BOTOX® in the correct       muscle, it can change the tightness in the muscle temporarily. Published reports indicate       that several hundred adult patients with arm and/or leg spasticity of various causes e.g.,       poststroke, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury have benefited from injections of       BOTOX® in the spastic muscle. The efficacy of BOTOX® in patients with post-stroke spasticity       in their arms and hands has been demonstrated in seven phase 2 placebo-controlled studies       and two phase 3 studies.        The present study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of injections of       BOTOX® in spastic muscles of the arm and hand compared with injections of saline which       would do nothing when combined with rehabilitation therapy for the improvement of active       function tasks in post-stroke patients. Injections will be targeted to reduce common       spasticity patterns of the arm and hand which include: bent elbow, palm down forearm, bent       wrist, thumb-in-palm, clenched fist, and other hand deformities.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Delayed sleep phase syndrome is the most common circadian disorder in adolescents and most       adults with the condition report onset of symptoms during childhood or adolescence. Delayed       Sleep Phase Syndrome involves a chronic mismatch between the usual daily schedule required       by the individuals environment and his or her circadian sleep wake pattern. Individuals       suffering from delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome experience great difficulty when attempting to       fall asleep before 1-2 am, if not later, as well as rising at acceptable hours of the       morning despite having completely normal sleep architecture and sleep duration. Delayed       Sleep Phase Syndrome is a sleep disorder that results from a dysregulation of the circadian       sleep-wake rhythm. Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome is often the cause of severe insomnia and is       associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, major depressive disorder and severe       disruption of education, work and social functioning. Its major symptom is extreme       difficulty initiating sleep at a conventional hour and waking on time in the morning for       school or work.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Alcohol use is ubiquitous in American society. 83% of Americans have ever consumed alcohol,       51% have in the lst month.        The average American consumes 2.18 gallons of ethanol yearly. Alcohol related morbidity and       mortality are staggering problems in the USA. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur because       alcohol is a central nervous system depressant; abrupt withdrawal unmasks compensatory       overactivity of certain parts of the nervous system, including sympathetic autonomic       outflow. 5% of patients who undergo alcohol suffer from Delirium Tremors DTs, a syndrome       characterized by hallucinations, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, low grade fever,       agitation, and diaphoresis.        DTs typically begin between 48-96 hours after the last drink and last 1 to 5 days. DTs       requires hospitalization and vigorous activity in an ICU setting.        The most successful drug treatment for alcohol withdrawal has been found to be the       benzodiazepines.        Symptom triggered treatment was found to be as effective as a fixed dose treatment to result       in less drug being used overall, with a trend toward shorter duration of withdrawal       treatment.        Baclofen is used orally for the treatment of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis,       spinal cord injuries/diseases and intrathecally for spasticity related to cerebral palsy,       spinal cord injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS.        Its proposed benefit in alcohol withdrawal is that it may reduce voluntary alcohol intake,       alcohol craving, and may suppress the intensity of alcohol withdrawal treatment.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00633503","TITLE:       Monitoring of Tissue Transfer Flaps by Modulated Imaging MI Spectroscopy SUMMARY:       Tissue transfer flaps are a method of moving tissue from a donor location to a recipient       location. In the case of a free tissue transfer flaps, the blood vessels to the transferred       tissues are detached and then re-attached to different arteries & veins at the recipient       site. The process of reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps allows for improved       results in terms of functionality, aesthetic appearance, and psychological well-being in       patients requiring reconstructive surgery after cancer resection or trauma. The process of       reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps is not without complications. These       complications may include acute arterial or venous occlusion, as well as the development of       late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy.        The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if a novel, unique, portable, non-contact       optical imaging device developed at the Beckman Laser Institute called Modulated Imaging       MI can detect changes in a flaps optical properties, which can correlate with arterial or       venous occlusion or with the development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy. The study would       also evaluate if changes in the tissue transfer flaps optical properties, as detected by       the device could be employed as a monitoring device in the post-operative period after       reconstructive surgery. The MI devices detection of specific optical properties of a tissue       flap could also potentially be used as a diagnostic tool to predict the likelihood of the       development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy in a delayed fashion several months after       reconstructive surgery.        Prior animal and clinical studies using similar devices have demonstrated that changes in       the total hemoglobin concentration and percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin in the tissue       transfer flap can be used to differentiate between arterial and venous occlusion. These       other similar devices have been shown to be able to detect venous occlusion prior to       clinical manifestations of venous occlusion using standard monitoring methods. This early       detection of venous occlusion has important implications. It is well established that early       detection and surgical re-exploration and correction of venous occlusion is associated with       improved survival and salvage rates of tissue transfer flaps. It has been suggested in the       reconstructive literature that the development of fat necrosis and flap atrophy are caused       by a relative arterial or venous insufficiency, which could be detected using the MI device       prior to the clinical manifestations of these complications.Patients undergoing       reconstructive surgery at UCI Medical Center will be recruited for enrollment into the       study. The study design requires following the patients and review their medical records in       order to determine the clinical outcomes of their reconstructive surgery. The process of       review of the medical record will require the review of both the in-patient medical record       during the hospitalization in which the reconstructive surgery takes place and the       outpatient medical record after surgery in order to observe for the possible development of       the acute and delayed complications of reconstructive surgery. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Objectives:          1. To develop a safe, non-contact, intra-operative & post-operative device, which can be            used as an adjunct to the clinical evaluation of tissue transfer flaps after            reconstructive surgery.          2. To develop an adjunctive device that can reliably detect and distinguish arterial and            venous occlusion before the clinical manifestations of such occlusions, and thus            provide the scientific basis for future studies which may use the device to potentially            improve the salvage rates after re-exploration for such complications.          3. To evaluate if changes in the optical properties of tissue transfer flaps during the            immediate post-operative period can be used to predict the development of late            complications of tissue transfer flaps, such as the development of fat necrosis and/or            flap atrophy.        Specific aims:          1. To record intra-operative and post-operative images of pedicle and free tissue transfer            flaps used in reconstructive surgery with a device that shines low energy near infrared            light that is spatially modulated into a sinusoidal configuration of amplitude called            Modulated Imaging MI.          2. To study if the MI device described above is able to collect data regarding the optical            properties of the tissue transfer flaps, which can then be used to detect acute            post-operative occlusion of the artery or of the vein going to and from the tissue            transfer flap.          3. To study if there is a correlation between the immediate post-operative optical            properties of tissue transfer flaps and the development of late complications such as            fat necrosis and flap atrophy.        Hypotheses:          1. Prior authors have demonstrated that tissue spectroscopy can be used in both animal &            human experiments to detect and differentiate between tissue transfer flaps with            adequate vascular supply vs. flaps with either artery and/or vein occlusions prior to            the detection of such complications using standard clinical observation during the            post-operative period. These authors demonstrated that detection of the changes from            baseline values in the post-operative period of the total hemoglobin [Hb-total],            deoxygenated hemoglobin [Hb-deoxy], and oxygenated hemoglobin [Hb-O2] concentrations            using tissue spectroscopy correlated with the clinical development of arterial or            venous occlusion. 1,2 As the MI device developed at the Beckman Laser Institute has            been demonstrated to be able to detect the [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy] and [Hb-O2] as well            as the concentration of water,[H2O] in a non-contact manner; we believe the MI device            will also be able to detect development of arterial and/ or venous occlusion in tissue            transfer flaps without requiring direct tissue contact with a tissue spectroscopy            device, as was the case with the instruments used by other authors.3, 4          2. There are higher rates of fat necrosis and flap atrophy that occur after specific types            of free tissue transfer flaps, [i.e., higher rates occur with Deep Inferior Epigastric            Perforator DIEP flaps vs. Transverse Rectus Abdominis TRAM flaps.5, 6 Some authors            have suggested that early flap congestion and the development of late fat necrosis may            be due to venous insufficiency, without complete venous occlusion 7. We hypothesize            that early post-operative changes in the flaps optical properties may be used to            predict the development of late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy, as            these complications are thought to be due to a relative arterial and/or venous            insufficiency to the tissue transfer flap; and thus should be reflected in the tissues            optical properties as detected by the MI device.        Rationale: The use of tissue pedicle and free tissue transfer flaps allows for increased       reconstructive possibilities for patients that have had disfigurement or loss of function       after trauma or oncological surgical resection. Generally, the process of creating a pedicle       tissue transfer flap involves the isolation of tissues onto a single artery and vein and       then rotating this tissue from the donor site to the site requiring reconstruction. A free       tissue transfer flap involves a process similar to the creation of a pedicle flap except       that the artery and vein going to the flaps tissues are divided and re-implanted at the       site of reconstruction. This process of using tissue transfer flaps however has known       complications, including acute complications such as arterial or venous occlusion and late       complications such as the development of fat necrosis and flap atrophy.        Acute complications involving the vascular structures of the flap can be either partial or       complete occlusion of the artery or vein going to and from the tissue flap. Both pedicle and       free tissue transfer flaps can develop severe complications if either the artery or vein is       compromised, including complete death of the tissue in the flap. If the vascular structures       going to the flaps are compromised then the tissues used for reconstructive surgery may       undergo damage. This tissue damage can become extensive and result in the loss of part or       the entire tissue mass in the tissue transfer flap, which in turn can result in increased       morbidity and mortality to the patient. In the reconstructive surgery literature, it has       been shown that frequent monitoring during the first 48-72 hours after reconstructive       surgery allows for early detection and intervention when a vascular compromised flap occurs.       This earlier detection then can translate into earlier interventions including surgical       re-exploration, which has been shown to improve the salvage rates of vascular compromise of       the tissue transfer flaps.8, 9 It is generally known that venous thrombosis has a worse       out-come, when compared to arterial thrombosis after surgical re-exploration and       reestablishment of blood flow. This difference between arterial and venous thrombosis is       thought to be due to the differences in the pathophysiology involved in venous congestion.       In venous thrombosis tissue fluid content is increased due to initially continued arterial       inflow, thus when venous out-flow is re-established the tissue edema continues to inhibit       the diffusion of oxygen through the interstitial space from the capillaries to the tissue       cells in the vascular beds were edema remains. The fact that venous thrombosis is more       difficult to clinically detect early may also contribute to the poorer prognosis associated       with venous thrombosis when compared to arterial thrombosis.10        Given the difficulty of early detection of venous thrombosis, and of the decreased rates of       successful salvage after surgical re-exploration for venous thrombosis, authors have       employed successfully the use of tissue spectroscopy to detect venous thrombosis several       hours before the clinical manifestations of thrombosis 2. These authors employed a       spectroscopy device, which requires direct contact with the tissues being evaluated and only       provided a small surface area in which the tissue flaps optical properties were measured.       The device, however, is able to provide both diffuse optical tomography and rapid wide-field       quantitative mapping of the tissues optical properties in a single measurement platform       through a device that does not require direct contact with the tissues being evaluated 3,       11. As theMI device is a new novel device developed at the Beckman laser Institute and has       not been used to evaluate human tissue transfer flaps this would be a pilot study. This       pilot study would seek to determine if this specific device is also able to detect vascular       occlusion prior to clinical detection of such occlusion, as well as to differentiate between       arterial and venous occlusions in a similar manner to other devices used by other authors,       which employed tissue spectroscopy to monitor tissue transfer flaps.        As mentioned above, delayed complications can develop after tissue transfer flaps are used       in reconstructive surgery, which include fat necrosis and flap atrophy. These late       complications are thought to be caused by a relative vascular insufficiency supplying the       flaps. It is proposed that the increased venous congestion and increased rates of fat       necrosis with the use of DIEP flaps when compared to TRAM flaps in breast reconstruction is       due to a relative venous insufficiency that is not diminished enough to cause flap loss, but       is on occasion great enough to result in the development of fat necrosis 7. The late       development of flap atrophy may also be due to a relative arterial or venous insufficiency       that occurs at the time of surgical reconstruction, and results in a relative global tissue       flap ischemia leading to the development of flap atrophy. One of the goals of this       experiment is to determine if any characteristic of the optical properties in a tissue       transfer flap in the near post-operative setting can predict the development of either fat       necrosis or flap atrophy.        The MI device is a novel unique device when compared to other spectroscopic devices used to       study tissue transfer flaps. MI uses a non-contact optical imaging technology developed at       the Beckman Laser Institute that has the unique capability of performing both diffuse       optical tomography and rapid, wide-field quantitative mapping of tissue optical properties       within a single measurement platform. While other non-contact spectroscopic devices use a       time-modulation methods, MI alternatively uses spatially modulated illumination for imaging       of tissue constituents. The MI system consists of 1 a light projection system that       illuminates the tissue with spatial sinusoid patterns, and 2 a CCD camera, which collects       the diffusely reflected light in a non-contact geometry. The wavelength of illumination can       be selected by bandpass filtering of a broadband source i.e. tungsten lamp, or by use of a       monochromatic source i.e. laser diode. Lastly, tissue fluorescence measurements can be       performed by placing a combination of source-blocking and bandpass emission filters in front       of the camera. 3, 11        The diffusely reflected amplitude of the modulated wave carries both optical property       absorption, fluorescence, scattering and depth information. Specifically, the sampling       depth of the spatially modulated wave is a function of the frequency of illumination and the       tissue optical properties. This shares many analogies to the broadband frequency-domain       photon migration FDPM approach. {12, 13} Consequently, measurement of multiple spatial       frequencies periodicities allows MI to perform two functions. First, use of a wide range       of frequency patterns allows depth-selective imaging and thus tomography of the internal 3D       tissue structure. Secondly, it can rapidly and quantitatively map optical absorption,       fluorescence yield, and scattering coefficients in near-real time, with high resolution and       over a wide field-of-view.        The ability to separate optical absorption from scattering distinguishes MI from       conventional planar reflectance imaging methods. Absorption and scattering maps can be used       to characterize the tissues biochemical composition and structure. We have shown that these       intrinsic tissue contrast elements vary with tissue types, and their wavelength dependence       provides spectral fingerprinting that can be used to delineate the spatial relationships       among tissues with different optical properties and can be used to determine the amount of       H2O, [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy], [Hb-O2] & Tissue Oxygen Saturation [StO2]. MI is able to detect       the concentration of [Hb-total], [Hb-deoxy] & [Hb-O2] in absolute amounts in units of       millimoles / unit volume of tissue measured. MI is also able to determine the percent       fraction of mass, which is comprised of H2O in terms of percent mass.11, 14. This feature is       critical to the performance of MI as a quantitative diagnostic method and, when combined       with its tomographic capabilities, underscores the uniqueness of the method, and its       potential use as a monitoring and diagnostic device to evaluate tissue transfer flaps after       reconstructive surgery.

In December 2004, Pfizer gained Food and Drug Administration       FDA approval for use of pregabalin in nerve pain associated with diabetes and shingles;       making it the first FDA-approved treatment for both of these nerve pain states.        Tremor is uncontrolled trembling in part of the body. Essential tremor ET is associated       with purposeful movemente.g., holding a glass to drink, shaving, writing and buttoning a       shirt. It occurs most often in the hands and head and also may affect the arms, voice box       larynx, trunk, and legs. ET is caused by abnormalities in areas of the brain that control       movement. It usually does not result in serious complications.        ET affects approximately 5 million people in the United States. Incidence is highest in       people over the age of 60.        ET usually develops gradually during middle age or later in life. Symptoms may remain mild       or become more severe over time. Stress, fatigue, anxiety, and hot or cold weather can       worsen the disorder. Severe tremor may cause difficulty doing activities of daily living,       such as:          -  Brushing hair and teeth          -  Holding a glass without spilling          -  Performing self-care e.g., getting dressed, shaving, putting on makeup          -  Using eating utensils          -  Writing and drawing        The purpose of this study is to examine the tolerability and efficacy of Pregabalin in       patients with ET .        In other words, can patients diagnosed with ET tolerate high dose of pregabalin? Will the       pregabalin be considered as an efficient medicine in the treatment of ET?

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Cardiac catheterization is conventionally performed with femoral arterial access using a       combination of arterial pulse palpation, anatomical landmarks, and fluoroscopic landmarks to       guide needle insertion. Vascular access complications including hematoma formation,       retroperitoneal bleeding, and arterial dissection are the most common types of adverse       events associated with cardiac catheterization, and have been associated with insertions       above and below the level of the common femoral artery. Real-time ultrasound assistance for       central venous catheter placement has been proven in multiple studies to reduce       complications, and has been recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as       a Top 11 Highly Proven patient safety practice. This recommendation has not yet been       extended to arterial access, due to a lack of studies to date. However, ultrasound       assistance is licensed for and commonly utilized for arterial access, especially in       difficult patients.        In a pilot study of 71 procedures performed by the lead researcher, ultrasound guidance was       associated with an improved 1st pass success rate 83% vs 47%, p=0.002, reduced risk of       accidental venipunctures 0% vs 25%, p=0.002, and greater overall success in common femoral       artery cannulation 89% vs 69%, p=0.048 as compared with the fluoroscopic control.        This study is a multicenter prospective randomized trial to generalize the above findings       with more patients studied, a larger number of operators, and across several centers.       Similar to the previous study, the ultrasound will be used real-time to visualize the       femoral vein, femoral artery, and needle tract as the needle is inserted, to guide the       needle towards the appropriate location in the artery. The time for insertion, number of       passes, complications, and position of the insertion catheter on the femoral angiogram will       be analyzed in the setting of patient factors including age, body mass index, and presence       of peripheral vascular disease.

These programs have been demonstrated to improve adherence to regular       physical activity, a healthy diet and smoking cessation, as well as modify risk factors for       IHD such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition,       CRP are cost effective and can result in a 25% reduction in reoccurrence of mortality.       Despite the known benefits of CRP, as little as 10% to 25% of eligible patients attend these       programs. One of the main barriers to attendance is proximity to a CRP, as the majority of       these programs are limited to hospitals in large urban areas. However, cardiovascular       diseases do not discriminate by geography, resulting in a geographic inequity of care for       patients living in rural, remote and smaller urban/sub-urban centres. Currently there are no       CRP specifically designed for patients in rural and remote areas. The use of the Internet       may present itself as a viable alternative. We have recently completed a pilot study of a       virtual CRP vCRP that demonstrated significant improvements in exercise capacity and risk       factors. This investigation will study the vCRP in a group of IHD patients who do not have       access to hospital-based CRP.        Hypotheses A. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will       result in significant improvements in exercise capacity compared to usual care, in patients       with diagnosed IHD.        B. Participation in a 4 month Internet-based cardiac rehabilitation program will result in       significant improvements in exercise capacity after one year compared to usual care, in       patients with diagnosed IHD.        Study Population Men and women over 18 years will be identified from consecutive in-patients       of the British Columbia Provincial Heart Centre at St. Pauls Hospital in Vancouver who       reside in either the Northern Interior or Coast Garibaldi health areas. Patients will be       eligible if they have IHD, Internet access, no previous experience with cardiac       rehabilitation and no physical limitations to exercise. A total of 74 patients 37 per       group will be recruited and randomized to either usual care, or a 4 month virtual cardiac       rehabilitation program delivered via the Internet.        Usual Care Group Patients randomized to usual care will be provided with simple guidelines       for safe exercising and healthy eating habits, and return to the care of their primary care       physician. Patients will return at 4 and 16 months later for outcome assessment. There will       be no contact between the study personnel and usual care patients for the duration of the       study, nor will there be any attempt to control the level of patient care.        Intervention The vCRP has been developed to mimic hospital-based CRP and includes online       intake forms, one-on-one chat sessions with vCRP nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist,       data collection exercise heart rate, blood pressure, glucose- if diabetic, peer-support       group chat sessions, ask-an-expert chat sessions, education, progress reports and online       resources. Upon randomization to the intervention, patients will receive access to the       website, a heart rate monitor and a blood pressure monitor and trained in their use. The       heart rate monitors allow for exercise heart rate data to be stored and downloaded to their       home computer and then uploaded to the vCRP webserver. The exercise data will be reviewed       weekly. A letter to the patients primary care physician will be sent to outline the vCRP       intervention, the treatment algorithms to be used and indicate under what circumstances the       vCRP nurse and/or patient may contact them with regards to their management. Patients will       receive one-on-one counselling by the nurse, dietitian and exercise specialist via chat       sessions at 3 to 4 week intervals. After the 4 month intervention, patients will be       discharged into the care of their primary care physician.        Outcomes Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 16 months for risk factors and       lifestyle behaviours. The primary outcomes will be the change in exercise capacity as       between the two groups from baseline to 4 months, and from baseline to 16 months. Exercise       capacity will be assessed as total time on a symptom-limited exercise stress test. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1.

Upon achieving the weight loss goal, subjects       will be randomly assigned to either a low-dairy or high-dairy eucaloric weight maintenance       diet for two years. Macronutrient distribution will be maintained constant and set at       approximately the U.S. average.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Dietary calcium plays a pivotal role in the regulation of energy metabolism, as we have       found high calcium diets to attenuate adipocyte lipid accretion and weight gain during       periods of over-consumption of an energy-dense diet and to increase lipolysis and preserve       thermogenesis during caloric restriction, thereby markedly accelerating weight loss. Our       studies of the agouti gene demonstrate a key role for intracellular Ca2+ in regulating       adipocyte lipid metabolism and triglyceride storage, with increased intracellular Ca2+       resulting in stimulation of lipogenic gene expression and lipogenesis and suppression of       lipolysis, resulting in adipocyte lipid filling and increased adiposity. Moreover, the       increased calcitriol produced in response to low calcium diets stimulates adipocyte Ca2+       influx and, consequently, promotes adiposity, while higher calcium diets inhibit       lipogenesis, promote lipolysis, lipid oxidation and thermogenesis and inhibit diet-induced       obesity in mice. Notably, dairy sources of calcium exert markedly greater effects in       attenuating weight and fat gain and accelerating fat loss. This augmented effect of dairy       products versus supplemental calcium is likely due to additional bioactive compounds in       dairy which act synergistically with calcium to attenuate adiposity. These concepts are       confirmed by both epidemiological and clinical data which demonstrates that increasing       dietary calcium results in significant reductions in adipose tissue mass in obese humans in       the absence of caloric restriction and markedly accelerates the weight and body fat loss       secondary to caloric restriction, while dairy products exert markedly greater nearly       two-fold compared to calcium supplements effects. These data indicate an important role for       dairy products in both the prevention and treatment of obesity. However, weight maintenance       following successful weight loss i.e. prevention of regain is at least as important as       strategies to initially achieve weight loss, as most individuals who successfully lose       weight are not successful in maintaining this weight loss. We have recently demonstrated       that ad libitum re-feeding of dairy-rich following weight loss in mice on an energy       restricted mice prevented the suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis and fat oxidation that       otherwise accompanies such re-feeding and markedly upregulated skeletal muscle fat       oxidation. Consequently, although animals re-fed low calcium diets rapidly regained all of       the weight and fat that had been lost, animals fed high calcium diets exhibited a shift in       energy partitioning and a 50-85% reduction in weight and fat gain; moreover, dairy exerted       markedly greater effects than supplemental calcium on weight and fat regain. However, the       effect of dairy on prevention of weight regain in humans has not yet been assessed in       clinical trials. Accordingly, the goal of the current study is to determine the role of       dairy in similarly preventing weight and fat re-gain in obese adults who have successfully       completed a weight loss diet program.        340 obese subjects will undergo a meal-replacement-based weight loss plan designed to       produce a 10 kg weight loss in 8-12 weeks.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00692198","TITLE:       Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial SUMMARY:       Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is a serious respiratory disease in which the       airways in the lungs are partially blocked, resulting in symptoms of chest tightness,       coughing, and difficulty breathing. Currently, there are many available treatments for       managing COPD symptoms and improving quality of life, including medications, lifestyle       changes, oxygen therapy, and pulmonary rehabilitation. For people with severe COPD that is       characterized by very low blood oxygen levels at rest, long term oxygen therapy can help to       prolong life and promote feelings of well-being. However, the effectiveness of supplemental       oxygen therapy for people with COPD that is characterized by only moderately low blood       oxygen levels at rest or normal blood oxygen at rest and desaturation on exercise is not       known. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen therapy in treating       people with COPD who have moderately low blood oxygen levels at rest or who have normal       blood oxygen levels at rest, but have low or very low blood oxygen levels during exercise. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 12 million       people currently diagnosed with the disease. Risk factors for COPD include smoking,       environmental exposure to lung irritants, and genetic predisposition. People with COPD often       experience symptoms of chronic cough, shortness of breath, excess mucus production, and       wheezing. In COPD, the airways in the lungs are chronically obstructed, and if left       untreated, this obstruction can cause significant damage to the lungs and lasting       disability. The quality of life of a person with COPD decreases as the disease progresses,       making treating and managing COPD in the moderate stages important. Long-term oxygen therapy       has been shown to help people with severe COPD that is characterized by very low blood       oxygen levels at rest to live longer and healthier lives. This study will determine whether       supplemental oxygen therapy is helpful for people with COPD that is characterized by       moderately low blood oxygen levels at rest or normal oxygen levels at rest and low or very       low levels during exercise.        Participation in this study will last at least one year and up to 7 years. Potential       participants will first undergo a screening visit that will include questionnaires, a       breathing test, measurements of resting and walking blood oxygen levels, a brief physical       exam, and a blood draw. Eligible participants will then return for a second screening visit,       during which they will complete more questionnaires. At the end of the second visit,       eligible participants will be assigned randomly to supplemental oxygen therapy or no oxygen       therapy.        Participants assigned to supplemental oxygen therapy will receive stationary and portable       oxygen systems. Shortly after receiving the portable oxygen system, participants will return       for a 1-hour visit to determine how much oxygen to use while walking and to learn how to use       the equipment. Participants who have low blood oxygen levels during rest will be instructed       to use supplemental oxygen 24 hours per day. Patients with normal resting blood oxygen       levels, but low or very low blood oxygen levels during exercise will be instructed to use it       during physical activity and sleep. Throughout the treatment period, participants will be       asked to keep records of the number of oxygen tanks emptied or pounds of oxygen delivered,       meter readings, and changes in equipment. Study officials will contact participants weekly       for the first month, monthly for the next 5 months, and then every 2 months until the Year 1       study visit. Participants will also complete a form about their oxygen equipment and usage       every 2 months. Participants assigned to receive no oxygen treatment will be contacted 1       week after study group assignment for a check-up.        All participants will return for study visits once a year for up to 7 years. At each of       these visits, participants will complete some of the same tests and questionnaires from the       screening visit. At the Year 1 visit, participants will also undergo a blood draw. Both       treatment groups will receive two phone calls each year to check on status and use of       oxygen. Participants in both groups will be asked to complete a quality of life       questionnaire by mail at 4 months and 16 months. Participants will also sign a release of       medical records form each year and will have their Medicare claims collected for the time       they are in the study.

SUMMARY:       The purpose of the study is to assess whether weight loss achieved through a programme of       intensive lifestyle management can result in enhanced production of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1       GLP-1 together with improvements in the release of insulin and glucagon and thus       improvements in glycaemic control HbA1c, in patients with new onset type 2 diabetes.        This is a cohort study with comparisons made between assessments at baseline, after an       initial four months of intensive intervention and after a further four months follow up       maintenance period. Each patient will participate in the study for 8 month. The entire       study period will be 24 months.        All patients with new onset type 2 diabetes within 2 weeks of diagnosis will be recruited       from those referred to the Type 2 Diabetes Education Programme in the community FOCUS,       as per standard practice. The investigators will also hope to recruit direct from local GP       surgeries who will be advised of the study. At this point, patients will be given a study       information sheet with a contact number if they wish to participate in the study.        Individuals who are unable to give consent, who would be unable to attend all the programme       sessions for medical or other reasons, who are prescribed oral hypoglycaemic, antiobesity or       any other prescription medications that may interfere with the study results or whose BMI is       < 25, will be excluded. The investigators will also exclude those who cannot converse       competently in English as special arrangements would need to be made for such people       attending the programme and this would be impractical in a group setting.        Those willing to participate will be invited for an individual appointment with the       dietitian, during which the study structure, aims and procedures will be explained and       consent to participate in the study will be obtained. For the first session of the       programme, participants will be asked to attend following an overnight fast. Blood samples       will be taken for basal measurement of glucose, HbA1c, lipids, insulin, glucagon, GLP-1,       leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin. They will then be given a standard 75 g glucose load and       sampling repeated at 30 mins for peak GLP-1 levels. Baseline measurements of weight,       height, percent body fat, waistline circumference and blood pressure will also be taken       during this session. Following the assessment, patients will participate in the first       session of the education programme. The full assessment will be repeated at 4 and 8 months       intervals.        The weight management programme will be run by the Specialist Dietitian. It will consist of       2 phases: an initial 4 month intensive weight loss phase, followed by a 4 month weight loss       / maintenance phase. The initial four month programme will consist of 8 group education       sessions and at least 3 phone calls. The following 4 month programme will consist of 5 group       sessions, at least 3 phone calls and 1 individual appointment. Each education session will       last 60min. Before the 1st session and, at 4 month and 8 month sessions, bloods will be       taken, as above. Before the rest of the sessions, there will be 15 minutes devoted to weight       assessment. The programme will be based on portion control and healthy eating and will be       supported by behavioural and cognitive change interventions. Such interventions will include       self monitoring, stimulus control, goal setting, problem solving and relapse prevention. The       specialists from Bournemouth HealthLink a partnership backed by the local NHS, Council       and University will take part in helping participants to increase their activity levels.        The aim is to achieve weight loss of 5% over the first 4 months with, as a minimum, weight       maintenance or possible further reduction over the subsequent four months. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The early management of type 2 diabetes usually consists of education related to lifestyle       changes especially as 80 to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are obese. Obesity worsens       the metabolic and physiological abnormalities associated with diabetes particularly       hyperglycaemia raised blood sugar, hyperlipidaemia raised fats in the blood, and       hypertension which are prerequisites for macrovascular complications. On the other hand,       weight loss is one of the cornerstones of diabetes management as it improves glycaemic       blood glucose control, lowers triglycerides a fat in the blood and low-density       lipoprotein cholesterol the bad form of cholesterol levels and improves blood pressure,       mental health and quality of life.        In 1993 the investigators established a structured education programme for patients with new       onset type 2 diabetes; following the diagnosis being made in primary care individuals are       seen within one week at a nurse led, open-access programme. Since 1994, there has been a 2.5       fold increase in the number of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in our area. At       diagnosis, Body Mass Index BMI has risen from 28.5 to 31.1kg/m2 associated with a fall in       HbA1c a blood test which gives a measure of long term control of diabetes levels from       10.3% to 8.1% at presentation. The lower HbA1c at diagnosis probably reflects earlier       detection and awareness of the condition. Since 2006, responsibility for providing the       education has been transferred to primary care.        More recently, a secondary care based dietitian led group weight management programme       comprising more intensive education sessions and regular phone contact was piloted in this       unit. A recent evaluation of this service of fifty one overweight and obese individuals who       completed the 3-month programme. Average weight loss at 3 months was 4.8 kg equivalent to       4.5 % baseline body weight. Follow up at six months, without further intervention, showed       that this was maintained weight loss 5.8 kg, equivalent to 5.3 %, ns compared to 3/12. 43%       of participants achieved >5% weight reduction with 6% achieving >10%. The intervention       resulted in significant reduction in waistline circumferences, body fat mass, total       cholesterol, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressure.        A number of neuro-endocrine factors hormones that influences the activity of the brain or       nervous system have a role in the control of insulin secretion and in the regulation of       food intake. Glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1 is an incretin hormone, the name based on the       observation that the insulin response to an oral glucose load was greater than that       following the intravenous administration of an equivalent amount of glucose. Incretin       hormones are secreted from the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients in       the intestinal lumen. Physiologically, GLP-1 enhances glucose-mediated insulin secretion and       suppresses glucagon a hormone that opposes the action of insulin secretion. GLP-1 also       induces satiety and improves gastric emptying. In studies of patients with established       diabetes, GLP-1 levels and the response to oral glucose have been shown to be attenuated and       administration of GLP-1 has normalized both fasting and post-prandial glucose levels. It       remains uncertain whether lower GLP-1 levels in established diabetes contribute to the       pathogenesis of the condition or are a consequence of chronic hyperglycaemia, though the       observation that GLP-1 levels are lower in obese subjects suggests the possibility that the       former may be the case.        Recently, the investigators measured GLP-1 levels in patients with newly diagnosed type 2       diabetes to assess the effect of an initial period of lifestyle and dietary adjustment. In       this pilot project 9 newly diagnosed patients time from diagnosis 25 + 5 days, 4 female       with mean BMI 27.6 kg/m2 were compared with 9 age, gender and body weight matched controls.       All participants had a 75g oral glucose tolerance test with measurements of glucose,       insulin, GLP-1 and glucagon with the diabetic patients having a repeat OGTT after 3 months.       Compared with controls, diabetic patients had higher glucagon levels, lower active GLP-1 at       baseline before the glucose load although AUC levels were not significantly different. After       3 months lifestyle adjustment, 5 patients had achieved weight loss 0.2 to 5 kg but 4 had       gained weight 2.7 to 6.5 kg, giving an average weight change for the group of 0.8 Kg. A       small change in HbA1c was observed 7.31% vs 6.96%, p=0.25. The levels of active GLP-1 were       augmented in the diabetic group accompanied by an increase in the insulin response at 30       mins. though glucagon levels were unaltered.        It is unclear whether more intensive lifestyle changes would result in greater improvements       in GLP-1 production and thus greater improvements in diabetic control. If GLP-1 production       can be enhanced early following diagnosis of diabetes, this may have favorable consequences       for the patient, as GLP-1 has been shown in animal studies and in vitro, to have a role in       the regulation of beta glucose sensing and proliferation of beta-cells.        A number of other neuroendocrine peptides have regulatory roles in energy homeostasis and       may influence insulin secretion and glycaemic control. Leptin is a protein hormone produced       by adipose fat tissue which has a key role in regulating energy intake and expenditure, a       suppressive effect on appetite and an increase in metabolism. Circulating leptin levels       reflect body fat mass. Leptin can enter the the Central Nervous System CNS at and interact       with centres in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. Despite these suppressive       effects, elevated levels have often been noted in obesity, possibly suggesting resistance to       the hormone, though may be a result of stimulation by increased insulin levels, which would       be expected in obesity. Leptin in turn can inhibit insulin release so a fall in leptin       resulting from weight loss may enhance insulin production and may therefore be beneficial in       patients with diabetes.        Unlike leptin, ghrelin is an orixigenic stimulates appetite hormone which acts via the       Growth Hormone secretagogue receptor. It is the only hormone known to stimulate increased       feeding and weight gain. Basal plasma levels are increased in malnutrition and decreased in       obesity. In some, but not all studies, insulin has been shown to be an inhibitor of ghrelin       release. An anticipated rise in ghrelin with weight reduction might offset the effects of       lifestyle intervention through stimulation of appetite and increased intake.        Adiponectin is an adipocyte fat cell hormone that modulates a number of metabolic       processes, including glucose regulation and fatty acid catabolism, and may have a role in       the metabolic derangements of type 2 diabetes. Though produced in adipose fat tissue,       plasma adiponectin levels are decreased in obesity as a consequence of down regulation.       Adiponectin has insulin sensitizing effects and has central effects on energy homeostasis,       promoting weight reduction. Levels of adiponectin have been found to be reduced in type 2       diabetes compared with non-diabetic controls. Weight reduction can increase circulating       levels. Again little is known about the effect of changes in adiponectin in the early stages       of type 2 diabetes. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1.

The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells       mainly because it can interact with water which makes up to 80% of cells to generate       reactive oxygen species ROS, especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we       can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography       examination and the blood ROS concentration. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to       clarify if the routinely applied X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher       concentration of ROS in the peripheral blood.        Study subjects will be participants of health check program at our hospital. The only       enrollment condition will be a scheduled X-ray computed tomography examination for either       lung 20 cases or heart 20 cases of the study subject. Another 20 participants receiving       health check program without X-ray computed tomography examination will be included as the       control group. The formal consent will be delivered to the participants of health check       program several days before their admission for health check and will be retrieved before       the proceeding of health check.        Measurements and comparison of ROS concentration will be performed in the sampled peripheral       blood before and after the performance of X-ray computed tomography examination during a       regular health check program. Totally 120 blood samples will be collected from included 60       study subjects within 3 months.

Malaria is an       infection of red blood cells caused by a parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that is spread by       certain kinds of mosquitoes. It affects at least 300 million people worldwide each year,       with more than 1 million deaths, mostly among children less than 5 years of age in       sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria is the leading cause of death and illness among the general       population of Mali in West Africa. Increasing drug resistance to P. falciparum and       widespread resistance of mosquitoes to pesticides are reducing the ability to control the       disease through these strategies. AMA1 C1 is made from a synthetic protein similar to a P.       falciparum protein. It is combined with Alhydrogel and CPG 7909, substances added to       vaccines to make them work better.        Children between 1 and 4 years of age who live in Bancoumana, Mali, and are in general good       health may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history,       physical examination, and blood and urine tests.

The shots are       given in the thigh muscle on study days 0, 56 and 180. After each shot, participants are       observed in the clinic for 30 minutes. They return to the clinic for a physical examination       six or seven times between each shot and then four more times over a 9-month period after       the last shot. Blood samples are drawn at several of these visits to check for side effects       of the vaccine and to measure the response to it. The total duration of the study is 21       months. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Globally, the Plasmodium falciparum parasite is responsible for at least 300 million acute       cases of malaria each year, with more than 1 million deaths. Approximately 90 percent of       these deaths, the majority in children under 5 years of age, occur in Africa due to       infection with Plasmodium falciparum. Morbidity and mortality caused by malaria also has       significant direct and indirect costs on the economic development of the endemic countries.       It is estimated that malaria accounts for 40 percent of public health expenditures, more       than 30 percent of inpatient admissions, and approximately 50 percent of outpatient visits       in some African countries. These factors, as well as growing drug resistance of the       parasite, widespread resistance of mosquitoes to insecticide, and increased human travel       necessitate the need for new approaches to malaria control and eradication. A vaccine that       could reduce both mortality and morbidity secondary to Plasmodium falciparum infection would       be a valuable resource in the fight against this disease.        Over time, people living in endemic areas develop natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum       as a result of repeated infection. Consequently, children who survive to 7 to 10 years of       age rarely succumb to life-threatening disease despite frequent infection. This acquired       immunity is mediated in part by blood-stage parasite-specific antibodies. Thus, parasite       proteins expressed during the blood-stage have been proposed to be good candidates for       inclusion in a vaccine. The purpose of a blood-stage vaccine is to elicit immune responses       that either destroy the parasite in the blood stream or inhibit the parasite from infecting       red blood cells, thus reducing or preventing complications of the disease.        A number of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens have been identified as promising       blood-stage vaccine candidates, including Apical Membrane Antigen 1 AMA1. The precise role       of AMA1 in the parasite is unknown; however, it is critical in the erythrocyte invasion       process across divergent Plasmodium species and for blood-stage multiplication of the       parasite. Recent analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum proteome detected expression of AMA1       in the sporozoite stage and suggests an additional role for AMA1 during the liver-stage       invasion. Therefore, an immune response against AMA1 may have an effect on liver-stage       parasites as well as having an impact on blood-stage parasites, thus protecting the host by       multiple immune mechanisms. Human and animal anti-AMA1 antibodies inhibit merozoite invasion       in vitro and correlate with protection against parasite challenge in animal models. T-cells       specific for Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 have also been demonstrated in individuals living in       endemic areas.        At least 68 known amino acid polymorphisms of AMA1 have been demonstrated, and animal       studies have shown that the polymorphisms in AMA1 are not immunologically silent. The       combination of two or more divergent AMA1 sequences within a single vaccine formulation may       reduce evasion of the host immune response by some Plasmodium falciparum field isolates.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The effectiveness of Sildenafil as a pulmonary vasodilator in children with heart disease       was first reported in detail during cardiac catheterization and postoperatively in 2003. It       is now used frequently for long-term treatment of children with pulmonary arterial       hypertension at The Hospital for Sick Children and it is now a routine part of the       hospitals testing protocol for all patients being evaluated for pulmonary hypertension in       the cardiac catheterization laboratory.        The beneficial effects of Sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension are thought to result       predominantly from relative vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary       vasculature. On the basis of early data showing lack of significant PDE5 expression in the       normal heart, PDE5 was thought to be expressed in the coronary vessels but not in the human       myocardium. Very recently, it was reported for the first time that PDE5 is markedly       upregulated in hypertrophied right ventricular myocardium in humans and that in the rat PDE5       inhibition with Sildenafil increases contractility in hypertrophied right ventricular       myocardium but not in normal right ventricle, which lacks PDE5 expression. The assessment of       right ventricular contractility in humans is a challenge, but we have developed several       techniques that are recognized as state of the art assessment of right ventricular       function.        The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Sildenafil, which is routinely       administered during cardiac catheterization to assess pulmonary vascular resistance, on       right ventricular contractility in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

These       are very common conditions and many patients have both diseases. Beta-blocker drugs are       extensively used in the treatment of angina, high blood pressure and after heart attacks to       decrease symptoms and prolong life. Beta-agonists are used in COPD to decrease       breathlessness and improve exercise tolerance. It used to be thought that beta-blockers       cannot be used in COPD patients as they may make the breathlessness worse, but it has now       been established that they can be used safely. Beta-blocker drugs and beta-agonists have       opposite effects on the body and the investigators do not know if they can work together       or if they would cancel each other out.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00759993","TITLE:       Chromium Piccolinate in the Prevention of Weight Gain Induced by Serotonergic Medications Initiated on Psychiatric Inpatient Units. SUMMARY:       A majority of patients who suffer from mental illness are treated with serotonin regulating       FDA approved medications. Some of these medications also block histamine transmission,       increase blood prolactin levels, induce insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and promote       sedation. All of which lead to weight gain and obesity. Many of these drugs are generally       safe and effective but do carry the risk of a long term side effect in that acute and       gradual weight gain of 10-30 pounds over a few months to a year of treatment. The       detrimental gain of 7% of pre-drug weight is reported with many antipsychotics, mood       stabilizers and some antidepressants. This weight gain may subsequently add to medical       co-morbidity  ie diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, coronary artery diseasem,       hyperlipidemia…  This therapeutic manipulation of brain serotonin functioning may be       associated with abnormal increases in carbohydrate cravings, consumption and weight gain. It       is possible that insulin resistance occurs as a direct effect or as an indirect effect of       weight gain, particularly in patients prone to weight gain or diabetes due to genetic       loading. Leptin, a chemical associated with feedback signaling that reduces appetite and       adipose tissue growth may also become insensitive. These multiple insults may lead to the       worst weight gain in patients taking clozapine, olanzapine, and mirtazapine.        Diet and exercise and lifestyle modification are the usual initial interventions, though       being depressed, anxious, bipolar, or schizophrenic often interferes with the ability to       make these changes. In fact most of the studies which look at these weight loss       interventions occur in patients who are institutionalized, on restricted diets and may       respond to token economy systems while on longer term inpatient unit stays. This token       economy approach is not easily translated to usual outpatient or short term inpatient       practice settings. In these settings, if lifestyle modification approaches fail, patients       may be placed on FDA approved diet medications sibutramine, orlistat, ionamin… which carry       significant side effect risks. Some patients are even placed on the epilepsy medications       such as zonisamide or topiramate at an even greater side effect risk.        In a similar weight gain prone group, there is growing literature in the diabetes population       that the use of high dose chromium improves lowers insulin resistance by way of increasing       insulin binding to cells, receptor numbers, and insulin receptor kinase activity. Lower       fasting blood glucose levels in the blood generally occurs. Some reports show a reduction in       blood lipid/cholesterol levels at higher chromium dosing as well. Recently, chromium       piccolinate was studied in depressed patients, especially those with atypical features       usually fatigue, weight gain, carbohydrate cravings. Although there was no change in       depression symptoms overall, carbohydrate cravings improved. This paper was presented at the       2005 American Psychiatric Association Annual Meeting in Atlanta. As a foil, a few papers in       non-diabetics,non-depressed healthy volunteers showed little to no effectiveness in lowering       blood sugar levels. Furthermore, one investigator JLM has published data showing acute ,       clinically significant weightgain in serotonergically treated psychiatric inpatients. The       authors theorize that the use of chromium may reduce carbohydrate craving, appetite and thus       protect against weight gain side effects.        Given this pivotal paper in the depressed population, effectiveness data in the diabetes       population and some possible metabolic ties between these two populations, the author wishes       to study the effect of chromium piccolinate in mentally ill subjects who are being started       on serotonergic manipulating medications while in an inpatient treatment setting. These       patients will be followed during their inpatient stay and then be followed after discharge       for a single visit to determine acute interventional effects of chromium piccolinate. We       feel chromium piccolinate is less toxic/hazardous than many of the weght loss medications       that we currently use and therefore suggest a long term randomized, controlled study where       subjects will receive active drug chromium piccolinate or placebo at the start of any       serotonergic treatment while inpatient. The chromium piccolinate and the placbo will be       obtained from the Nutrition 21 company, which has been approved by the FDA as a source of       this product.

MR spectroscopy using 2D-CSI a multi       voxel technique of the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, lobar white matter and brainstem may       reveal areas of injury and quantification of the metabolites from these areas may be used to       correlate with imaging findings and clinical evaluation. White matter disruption in these       areas is commonly seen after TBI, caused by diffuse axonal injury. It has been implicated in       the long term outcomes in these patients, but has been difficult to assess by standard       radiologic studies.        By the use of DTI it may be possible to demonstrate damaged white matter tracts which could       be helpful in the evaluation of traumatic brain injury. Most TBI subjects have injuries that       involved torque to the brain. This results in a shearing injury to the long white matter       tracts, which has been hypothesized to be related to cognitive outcome.        Also, to demonstrate that MRS and DTI prove valuable in predicting outcome in patients of       moderate brain trauma by conducting progressive studies acutely within 24 hours and long       term 4-6 weeks. Most patients will most likely be followed clinically for over a year,       and, if clinical indicated, farther scanning can be done at a later date.        By comparing fraction anisotropy, ADC values, and metabolic ratios by the use of DTI and MRS       in the adult and pediatric populations, may help to assess differences in recovery.        Lastly, a comparison between the two groups in changes in brain metabolism and/or white       matter tract disruption/re-connection after TBI with and/or without links to outcome can be       done.

All patients undergoing cardiac or       arterial catheterization by the Interventional Cardiovascular Medicine Service at The       Brigham and Womens hospital from 3/1/02 to the onset of the study and who had femoral       venous access during that time were considered for closure of the venous site; however, the       decision to use the closure device was left to the discretion of the physician.       Contraindications to using the closure device include a groin hematoma that had developed       during the procedure and/or difficult access due to extensive scar tissue from surgery or       multiple prior vascular accesses.        All in-hospital endpoints have been collected in the pre-existing Catheterization Laboratory       Database. Patients data will be extracted from this database as indicated in the procedure       below. Each patient will be reviewed for clinical follow-up and the presence of adverse       events including but not limited to hematoma, thrombosis, blood loss, vascular imaging, the       need for additional procedures, and re-admissions within 30 days of closure. If necessary,       further data will be collected via a phone interview with the patients. Univariate and       multivariate analysis will be performed to determine the factors that predict inadequate or       incomplete closure or the development of complications mentioned in the section above. A       predictive model based on the identified risk factor will be developed and tested       prospectively in the next phase of this ongoing investigation. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  All consented pts. over the age of 18 who received sutured mediated femoral vein              following catheterization          Exclusion Criteria:            -  Pt.s who are unable to give consent.            -  Pts. whose participation in research is contraindicated for medical reasons are              excluded.

The amended study is PROTECT CONTINUED ACCESS PROTECT CA. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This was a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single-arm, open-label post market       surveillance study designed to expand safety information in patients treated with the       Endeavor® Zotarolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System.        Since their introduction, Drug Eluting Stents DES have markedly decreased stent restenosis       and the clinical need for repeat revascularization frequently observed with bare metal       stents BMS1-10. However, the widespread use of DES has raised concerns regarding the       occurrence of late stent thrombosis > 30 days after stent implantation12-14. Although the       incidence might seem low 0.2-0.7%13,15-18 the high mortality and morbidity associated with       stent thrombosis, and the soaring number of stents implanted annually, make it a significant       medical problem.        The purpose of this trial was to investigate the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of       the Endeavor drug eluting stent in a large and higher risk patient population, which more       closely reflects clinical practice today. Both unstable and stable patients with single or       multivessel disease and complex lesions were eligible for enrollment.        The selected primary endpoint was stent thrombosis, defined as definite and probable stent       thrombosis according to the ARC definition, at 3 years. The main secondary endpoints were       the composite of death or cardiac death combined with large or all non-fatal myocardial       infarction, which are the typical clinical manifestations of stent thrombosis.

The secondary hypothesis is that patients who are blinded to the inhaled NO       concentration will sustain subjective improvement in their perception of dyspnea based upon       their reported Borg dyspnea score, during inhalation of NO.        Specific aims          1. Test if patients with acute PE and shortness of breath of severity ≥ 5 on a 0-10 scale            called the Borg score can have inhaled nitric oxide administered via nasal cannula or            face mask in a titration protocol that increases concentration by 5 ppm in 5 min steps            to a maximum of 25 ppm.          2. We will measure the number of patients who meet an absolute safety endpoint during            titration. An absolute safety endpoint requires execution of a rapid weaning protocol            2 ppm decrease per minute to 0 ppm.             Absolute safety endpoints: Two consecutive SBP measurements more than one min apart            with both readings < 80 mm Hg;SaO 2 <80% for more than 15 seconds; Patient            deterioration as defined by: Clinical decision for need of inotropic or pressor support            for any reason, seizure, new altered mental status, focal neurological signs suggestive            of cerebral ischemia, evidence of myocardial ischemia, protracted vomiting.          3.

Inclusion criteria will include moderate to severe shortness of breath as rated by the       patient on a standard scoring system, a systolic blood pressure of >89 mm Hg unless the       patient has a known prior history of low blood pressure, and blood oxygen saturation of       >80%. Exclusion criteria will include: altered mental status, inability to use a nasal       cannula, a large need for supplemental oxygen, pregnancy, pneumothorax, recent use of       nitrate-containing medications, recent use of thrombolytic drugs, requirement for inotropic       or pressor support, or a level of methemoglobin greater than 10%.        After obtaining informed consent, subjects will have blood drawn and vital signs will be       obtained. They will subsequently begin to breathe oxygen and NO supplied through a nasal       cannula delivered from the iNOvent device. The patients will undergo serial measurements of       their blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation and will have their serum methemoglobin       level monitored via a non-invasive probe. Titration of the amount of NO delivered will be       made periodically based on the patients vital signs. If an absolute safety endpoint is       reached, NO will be rapidly weaned. Based on the patients response to NO as determined by       their vital signs, a maintenance dose of NO, not to exceed 25 ppm, will be reached. Subjects       will continue to receive this concentration for up to 2 hours prior to weaning. Patients       will be asked once more to rate the severity of their shortness of breath and blood will be       drawn just prior to weaning. Should the patient reach a safety endpoint, the NO will be       weaned at an earlier timepoint.        We will determine the percentage of patients able to complete the full protocol without       reaching a safety endpoint, the percent change in methemoglobin level, the trend in       patient-reported shortness of breath, percent change in SBP and oxygen saturation and the       number of patients who withdraw during induction for any reason.

Low back pain has severe economic ramifications. Most incidents of low back pain       occur during the prime working years of life, with an estimated cost to the economy at       $14,744 Canadian dollars per person per year Health Canada, 1998. Indirect costs in the       form of long-term disability were highest for disorders of arthritis and chronic back pain       Health Canada, 1998. It has been estimated that 12 percent of patients will experience       disability within one year after their first episode of low back pain Banner, 2006.       Evidence based diagnosis and treatment is important for desirable outcomes.        The investigators predict that there will be changes in A trunk muscle electromyographic       patterns and in temporo-spatial gait patterns following osteopathic treatment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Research has outlined trunk muscle activation patterns in patients with LBP are different       from those who do not suffer from low back pain Clarke-Davidson and Hubley-Kozey, 2005;       Hodges, 1996 and 1997; McGill, 2001 and 2002. Osteopathic research has documented the       effects of osteopathic manipulative therapy OMT on EMG activity in patients with low back       pain Beckman, Harrington, Dostert, et al., 1991; Ellestad, Nagle, Boesler, et al.,1988;       Krpan, Harrington, Beckman, 1992; Steiner, Park, Guzels, 1991 however these studies were       limited in design and methodology.        In a controlled trial which measured levels of cellular enzymes to monitor tissue damage       during OMT, blood serum enzyme levels did not change as a result of manipulation. More       important, EMG levels decreased. OMT did not damage tissue but changed motor neuron activity       Rowane, Horner, Warner, et al., 1989. Beckman, et al., 1991 observed a reduction in EMG       activity following OMT in patients with low back pain and found increased skin blood flow as       measured by laser doppler flow meter. Steiner et al. 1991, reveal reduction to muscle       spasm as measured by EMG in patients with low back pain following OMT. A further study       Ellestad, et al., 1988 noted decreased EMG activity during motion in patients with chronic       low back pain. Thus there is preliminary work providing support for reduced EMG activity       following OMT within low back pain treatment groups. However there is a need for further       research in this area.        We also want to determine the role of manual therapy osteopathy in the management of gait       dysfunction in this patient population. Patients with LBP present with reduced gait speed,       poor thoraco-pelvic coordination and increased erector spinae activity Lamoth et al. 2002       and 2006, altered weight bearing Ellen Lee et al., 2007 and reduced single leg stance       balance in static conditions Louto et al., 1998.        Reduced thoraco-pelvic coordination leads to muscular stabilizing effects, altered       kinematics, trunk rigidity, and reduced walking velocity Lamoth et al., 2002. Specific       impairments of body structure and function can reduce gait speed in older adults Kerrigan,       Todd, Della Cruce, 1998. Osteopathic intervention targets movement impairments of body       structure and should change gait speed in patients with chronic LBP. Mal-alignment       contributes to pathology in the pelvis and lumbar spine which can lead to degenerative       changes, instability and pain Aebi, 2005; Gurney, 2002; Steinburg, Luger, Arbel, et al.,       2003. The focus of osteopathy is to restore mobility and alignment throughout the whole       kinetic chain Kutchera and Kutchera, 1991; Seffinger, 2007.        Improvement in gait speed and joint motion is shown after mobilization exercises to the       ankle and hip in the elderly Christiansen, 2003. A kinetic relationship links the ankle       and pelvis Gurney, 2002; Khamis & Yizhar, 2007; Pinto, Souza, Tede, et al., 2008.       Cephalo-caudal pelvis affects ankle, caudal-cephalo ankle affects pelvis and       ipsilateral-contralateral one leg affects the other via the pelvis alignment and kinematic       relationships occur when lower extremity joints are maintained in altered positions Pinto,       et al., 2008.

To stop the fluid from coming       back again, patients are given a medicine talc into the chest drain to seal up the space       around the lung. This procedure is known as pleurodesis. This sometimes causes pain and       discomfort, and the investigators do not know the best way of preventing this.        The investigators hope to find the best way to prevent pain during pleurodesis. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Patients with metastatic cancer often have fluid collecting around the lung as a result of       cancer cells spreading to the membranes adjacent to the lung malignant pleural effusion.       The standard way of treating this condition, which may cause unpleasant symptoms such as       breathlessness and cough, is to drain the fluid off and then seal the cavity, using a drug       talc given into the chest drain. Talc causes inflammation in the lining of the lung and       chest wall, sticking the two surfaces together and preventing fluid from recurring. This       procedure is often very painful; the pain may be partly related to the size of the chest       tube used and the type of analgesia taken by the patient during the procedure. Reducing the       amount of pain associated with this procedure would be a substantial benefit for patients       undergoing this procedure.        This trial is looking at which of two different drug regimens is more effective in       preventing pleurodesis pain, and whether the size of chest tube influences pain. It will       also address whether either of these influences success rate of pleurodesis.        We hope to learn whether the size of chest drain or the type of pain medication given       ibuprofen or morphine influences the amount of pain felt after the pleurodesis procedure.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00906971","TITLE:       Physiotherapeutic Intervention in Children With Chronic Functional Constipation SUMMARY:       The purpose of this study is to determine whether physiotherapy is effective in the       treatment of the chronic functional constipation in children. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       1 INTRODUCTION        Chronic functional constipation CFC is a common problem in the pediatric population,       affecting approximately 25% of those seeking specialized medical care. The complaint is       multifactorial, involving environmental, psychological and physiological factors, which       interact with the brain-gut axis, but the retention of stools secondary to the       pain-restraint cycle, associated to the fear and anxiety of the resulting bowel movement, is       important in the development and management of CFC.        Difficulties involved in the management of CFC are common. Conventional treatment includes       educational measures, disimpaction, laxatives and an increased fiber intake. However, these       measures have not necessarily been beneficial for all cases, with a cure ratio of between 50       and 60%, and around one third of all patients become long-term sufferers of constipation.        The muscles of the intestine contribute to atonic constipation - sluggish or flaccid muscles       in the bowel or rectum, or spasticity - increased muscle tone due to emotional stress. These       two factors are both present in patients with CFC. Bowel movement depends on the interlinked       functions of abdominal muscles, the pelvic floor and diaphragmatic breathing: contraction of       the diaphragm, abdominal distention resulting from the voluntary relaxation of the abdominal       wall and the pelvic floor lead to increased intra-abdominal and peristaltic pressure and       relaxation of the external anal sphincter EAS, thus culminating in bowel movement. Added       to which, activity of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system causes an increase in       gastrointestinal motility and relaxation of the sphincters. The superficial and deep       abdominal muscles, in addition to the diaphragm and muscles of the pelvic floor, form a       single muscle unit that assists regular bowel movement, and should all be worked together in       order to stimulate peristalsis. Therefore, a combination of exercises that stimulate and       relax the abdominal muscles, indirectly acting on the pelvic floor, coordinated with       diaphragmatic breathing, may trigger contraction of the intestinal and rectal muscles,       therefore bringing relief to patients with CFC.        Multidisciplinary treatment can complement the conventional treatment of CFC. Physiotherapy       exercises for the abdominal muscles and diaphragm plus abdominal massage may reverse any       changes brought on by CFC. Retraining the intestinal functions is brought about due to two       main effects:          1. mechanical - stimulating colonic movements, improving coordination of the muscles            involved in bowel movement, thus encouraging fecal propulsion and increasing abdominal            muscle tone;          2. neurological - parasympathetic stimulation increases muscle motility, while sympathetic            stimulation reduces anxiety, promoting relaxation and increasing endogenous serotonin,            thus reducing discomfort and increasing a sense of well-being. However, little evidence            of physiotherapy exercises applied to patients with CFC is available in the literature,            and randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed.        The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of muscular training, abdominal massage       and diaphragmatic breathing in patients with CFC. The hypothesis is that exercises for       training abdominal muscles, a diaphragmatic breathing pattern and abdominal massage increase       the frequency of bowel movements and reduce episodes of fecal incontinence in patients with       CFC.        2 METHODS        Design overview        A randomized, controlled trial was conducted with two parallel groups. In the physiotherapy       group, physiotherapy exercises will be employed isometric training of the abdominal       muscles, diaphragmatic breathing exercises and abdominal massage together with conventional       treatment disimpaction, when necessary, a high-fiber diet, laxatives and toilet training.       Patients in the medication group will be only submitted to conventional treatment.       Disimpaction will be conducted with phosphate saline solution once a day, from one to five       days, according to patient needs. During toilet training, the patient will be instructed to       sit on the toilet for at least five minutes, with support for the feet, after the three main       meals of the day.        Setting and participants        The trial will carried out in the Pediatric Unit at Hospital das Clínicas at Federal       University of Pernambuco UFPE, which provides patients with tertiary health care. Children       and adolescents aged between 4 and 18 years take part in the study.        For inclusion in the study, patients will be considered with CFC presented two or more of       the following parameters in the basal period, at least once a week, during the previous       two-month period, according to Rome III criteria: two or less bowel movements per week, at       least one episode of fecal incontinence per week, reports of retentive behavior, episodes of       hard stools or pain during bowel movements, presence of a large quantity of stool in the       rectum and large diameter stools, which could obstruct the toilet. Exclusion criteria will       be patients who take medication that caused constipation, patients with organic causes and       children with cognitive problems to perform the protocol. Children aged four to six years       were assessed for their ability to complete the physiotherapy exercises. This assessment       will consist of a few repetitions of the protocol conducted shorter after completing the       forms, where difficulty in completing protocol exercises will considered non-inclusion       criteria, so as not to interfere with the results.        Parents or guardians will sign the terms of informed consent after receiving information on       the aims and procedures of the study. A specially structured form will apply regarding signs       and symptoms of CFC. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research involving       human beings at the Centro Integrado de Saúde Amaury de Medeiros Registration 085/08.        Randomization and interventions        A table of random numbers will be created in the computer by someone not involved in the       study, from which will determined the random distribution sequence of the patients. This       information will remain the exclusive knowledge of one research assistant, who will use       these numbers to allocate patients by order of study entry, immediately after giving their       consent to take part. This will only made known to the researchers after statistical       analysis.          -  Physiotherapy + medication group Intervention Physiotherapy exercises will be            conducted by one single generalist physiotherapist, specially trained to perform the            exercises during the three months prior to the study. Twelve individual sessions will            be held twice a week, each lasting forty minutes, and adherence will be confirmed only            if patients attended all twelve sessions. A one-minute rest period will be observed            between each series of exercises.               -  Isometric training of the abdominal muscles The aim of the training will be to                 increase intra-abdominal pressure which compresses the intestines and the                 colonic propulsive force during voluntary effort. Considering that there is                 indirect synergic activation between the pelvic floor muscle and the lower                 abdominal muscle, the operation of the voluntary isometric contraction of the                 upper abdomen and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower abdomen improves muscle                 coordination, relaxation of the pelvic floor and relaxation of the external anal                 sphincter, thus optimizing bowel movement. This consist of a contraction of the                 upper abdomen muscle and diaphragm and the simultaneous relaxation of the lower                 abdomen, under the supervision of the physiotherapist. Training will be carried                 out in two manners: with the patient lying in a left lateral decubitus position                 with the hip and knee flexed at 90º and sitting. In the lying method, training                 began with two series of eight contractions and relaxations, into the third week,                 and then will increase to two series of twelve contractions and relaxations, and                 will remain so until the sixth week. In the sitting method, training will begin                 with one series of three contractions and relaxations lasting ten seconds,                 increasing to five repetitions in the third week, and remaining so until the sixth                 week. The exercise will considered successfully carried out when a protrusion of                 the lower abdomen was visible, indicating the simultaneous relaxation of the lower                 abdomen and the pelvic floor, from which point the series was initiated.               -  Breathing exercises The aim was to achieve a regular pattern of abdominal                 breathing and strengthen the abdominal muscle, improving coordination between                 breathing, the abdominal and anal muscles and colonic propulsion. Standard                 diaphragmatic breathing will achieve with a modified exercise, under the                 supervision of the physiotherapist, with the patient in a seated position, with                 one hand placed on the abdomen and the other on the thorax, and will be instructed                 to breath in slowly, deeply and progressively for 6 to 8 seconds, retain the air                 for 10 seconds and exhale slowly for 6 to 8 seconds. Two series will be completed,                 with ten repetitions, and the exercise was considered successfully performed when                 greater mobility of the hand placed on the abdomen achieves, compared to minimal                 or no mobility of the hand on the thorax, from which point the series was                 initiated.               -  Abdominal massage The aim will be perform propulsive abdominal massage to promote                 colonic and rectal motility, and train the intestinal function and bowel movement.                 The physiotherapist will perform slow circular clockwise movements, along the line                 of the colon, applying constant moderate pressure to the abdomen with a regular                 tennis ball, remaining on each point for one minute, beginning with the ascending                 colon moving in the direction of the sigmoid colon.               -  Medication and guidance Patients will use a laxative magnesium hydroxide, for                 which the dosage will vary according to individual needs a minimum of 2 ml/kg,                 and will receive guidance regarding fiber-rich foods, water and toilet training.                 Patients will attend weekly consultations with a pediatric gastroenterologist, who                 will be unaware of which patients belonged to which treatment group, since                 patients were only receiving clinical follow-up.          -  Medication Group Control Patients in this group will be monitored on a weekly basis            by a pediatric gastroenterologist, who will be unaware of which patients belonged to            which treatment group, since patients were only receiving clinical follow-up. All            patients will be prescribed a laxative magnesium hydroxide, for which the dosage            varied according to individual needs a minimum of 2 ml/kg, and will receive guidance            regarding fiber-rich foods, water and toilet training, under the same conditions as            patients in the intervention group.        Sample size Since there are no other similar studies, the sample was calculated from a study       that instructed children to achieve bowel movements sitting on the toilet. A reduction was       encountered of 80% in fecal incontinence in the intervention group and 55% in the control       group. The effect on the reduction of fecal incontinence < one/week was estimated at 25%       in favor of the intervention. Epi-Info 6.04 was employed, using p=5% power=80%, which       resulted in 72 participants.        Outcomes and follow-up The frequency of bowel movement and retentive fecal incontinence will       be the primary outcome measures. Pain and increased effort for bowel movement, consistency       of stools and retentive behavior will be secondary outcome measures.        During follow-up, parents or guardians will keep a diary describing the intestinal habits of       the children. These data will be checked and handed in weekly to the research assistant.        Statistical analysis Statistical analysis to compare the two groups at the end of the       follow-up period with regard to the primary and secondary outcome measures will be blind, by       intention-to-treat, considering loss of follow-up as treatment failure. In such cases, at       the end of the follow-up period, the frequency of bowel movement and fecal incontinence will       be recorded, as well as the response to other variables, reported at the beginning of the       study. The chi-squared test will be used for proportions and the Student t-test for       numerical variations with normal distribution the Bartlett test was used to verify the       homogeneity of the variance. The Mann-Whitney test will be used for numerical variables       with non-normal distribution. Statistical significance will set at p<0,05. All analysis will       be performed using the Epi-Info™, version 6.04d CDC - Center of Disease Control and       Prevention, Atlanta, USA and WHO World Health Organization, Geneva, swirtzerland.        An intragroup treatment additional exploratory analysis will be also conducted to assess the       function of retentive behaviour and fear of bowel movement in the frequency of bowel       movement at the end of treatment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Weight loss can be caused by loss of body mass due to metabolism and by water loss as       insensible water loss, sweating, or excretion in feces and urine. Eighty-three percent of       the total weight loss is due to insensible water loss from airways and skin. Water loss rate       varies according to changes in activity and ambient temperature and humidity. Although       weight loss during sleep is a well-known phenomenon, there are no studies relating it to       sleep structure or any other functions during the distinct sleep stages, particularly SWS       and REM sleep. There is evidence suggesting a homeostatic mechanism for weight control in       animal models and humans. This mechanism is thought to be dependent on energy intake, energy       expenditure, and environmental conditions. The literature suggests that sleep is important       for weight homeostasis on a long term since sleep shortage is associated with overweight       status, but overnight weight variation had not yet been studied. Considering these facts, we       hypothesized that the overnight weight loss rate is not uniform throughout the sleep period.       We also intend to compare weight loss rate during sleep and awake rest.        Intervention: Normal and obese volunteers will undergo whole night polysomnography with       continuous body weight and temperature register after an adaptation night. After that,       volunteers will remain awake resting in bed during the following day for continuous weight       and temperature register.

People with diabetes who receive beta-blockers may       experience adverse health effects, but the exact cause of why this happens remains unknown.       This study will examine the genetic factors that may influence how atenolol, a beta-blocker       medication, affects fat breakdown, blood sugar levels, and heart function in people with       type 2 diabetes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       People with diabetes who develop CVD have worse health outcomes than people without diabetes       who develop CVD. Beta-blockers are medications used to treat high blood pressure, angina       i.e., chest pain, arrhythmias, and other CVD conditions. While beta-blockers are effective       at treating these conditions, they may also have damaging effects on cholesterol or glucose       levels, thereby possibly lessening their ability to prevent CVD events in people with       diabetes. It is important to identify which patients may not benefit from receiving       beta-blocker medications. Genetic factors may influence how people respond to beta-blocker       medications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of genetic variation on       beta-blocker-induced changes in insulin sensitivity, fat breakdown, and heart function in       people with type 2 diabetes.        This study will enroll people with type 2 diabetes. At a series of up to three baseline       study visits, participants will have a blood collection, a glucose tolerance test, an       echocardiogram to obtain images of the heart, and biopsies of muscle from the thigh and fat       from the stomach. All participants will then receive atenolol once a day for 8 weeks. During       Week 1, participants will receive a low dose of atenolol. They will then attend a study       visit at the end of Week 1, and study researchers will examine how well participants are       tolerating the medication. If the atenolol is well tolerated, the dose will be increased.       Study researchers will call participants 1 week after any dosage changes to monitor for side       effects. Blood collection will occur again at a study visit at Week 4. At Week 8,       participants will then attend up to three study visits for repeat baseline testing.       Participants will then be slowly tapered off of atenolol over a 1-week period.

VKA related ICH occurs 8-10 times more frequently and the mortality is 2       times higher than in non-anticoagulated patients. Mortality may rise up to 67%. The higher       mortality rate may in part be due to the higher rate of haematoma expansion HE over a       longer period after symptom onset. International guidelines recommend treatment of VKA-ICH       with prothrombin complex PCC or fresh-frozen plasma FFP both in combination with       Vitamin-K. But these recommendations are not based on randomized controlled trials. It is       known that these drugs lower the INR, and thus it is assumed that normalization of       coagulopathy may lead to haemostasis and reduction of HE. Safety and efficacy of these       treatments have never been studied in a prospective controlled trial.

Cognitive training has been successfully used to improve       attention and processing speed in other patient populations as well as healthy elderly. The       purpose of this study is to examine how effective cognitive training will be in Veterans       with PTSD. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       1. Objectives Post Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD has been established as relatively            common in a significant number of OEF/OIF Veterans Vasterling & Brailey, 2005; Hoge et            al., 2008. Attention deficits, which are prominent in PTSD, may be due to difficulty            sustaining attention over time and encoding or getting information into storage which            leads to reduced attention and memory scores on neuropsychological measures.            Disruptions in attention are common in many types of neurological and psychiatric            disorders. Deficient attentional skills may negatively affect cognitive performance in            other areas e.g., memory, planning and thereby reduce effectiveness navigating daily            life tasks as well as decrease the Veterans life satisfaction after returning home.             The origin of the attention impairment may be amenable to sophisticated remediation            approaches using a bottom up, neuroscience based visual training program i.e., Posit            Science, Inc. cognitive rehabilitation program, which has been successful in improving            neurocognitive function in healthy older adults e.g., Mahncke et al., 2006 and            patients with Schizophrenia e.g., Bell at al., 2008. By engaging Veterans with PTSD            in targeted remediation, it is expected that both behavioral seen in            neuropsychological test gains and neural activity e.g., BOLD response through fMRI            will reflect the improvement and this may be linked to improved outcomes in daily            functioning.          2. Research Design: The longitudinal research design for this project will be a three            factor mixed factorial design with between subject factors of PTSD +PTSD x -PTSD and            cognitive remediation [cogrem x video game] and within subject variable of time tested            pre-training, post-training, 3 month follow up. There will be 40 participants            enrolled in the following groups of 10 each: 1 +PTSD/cogrem, 2 +PTSD/video game, 3            -PTSD/cogrem, and 4 -PTSD/video game. PTSD status is determined by a diagnosis of PTSD            identified through a clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The            active treatment is cognitive training. Veterans in this group will receive the Posit            Science Mahncke et al., 2006 visual cognitive remediation paradigm of 40 hours of            training. The control treatment is a video game designed by Nintendo for the DS            handheld system, which intended to improve mental functioning called Brain Age            Nintendo, Inc. which will be played for 40 hours. Groups will be compared on the            difference scores for neuropsychological, neurobehavioral and neuroimaging data to see            if there is a benefit in cognitive training and if that benefit is greater in the group            with PTSD.          3. Methodology: Forty outpatient Veterans will be enrolled. All individuals will receive a            neurobehavioral interview, neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging at the baseline            visit, post training and at follow-up visits. After the baseline visit, each volunteer            will be randomized to one of two conditions.          4. Findings: This is a new study and there are no findings to date.          5. Clinical Relationships: This study will examine the effects of a standard cognitive            rehabilitation program with OEF/OIF veterans who have cognitive deficits due to PTSD.          6. This project will impact veterans healthcare by identifying cognitive problems in PTSD            and will test the ability of a rehabilitation program to remediate those problems.

The       study hypothesizes that exercise, spinal manipulation, and a mind-body technique called       neuroemotional technique NET equally affect pain intensity and disability associated with       pregnancy-related low back pain. The study also hypothesizes that pain intensity and       disability levels do not influence maternal heart rate variability a measure of stress and       intrauterine attachment a measure of relationship quality. Ten women will additionally       provide blood and salivary oxytocin samples during pregnancy and periodically for three       months after birth. These women and their babies will also be videotaped playing for 5       minutes at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months postpartum. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Pregnancy-related low back pain is experienced by over half of all pregnant women. In the       United States it is thought of as a normal constituent of pregnancy. However, in Europe low       back pain associated with pregnancy is treated. In the United States pregnancy-related low       back pain is thought to resolve with birth. However about 1/3 of women who experience       pregnancy-related low back pain continue to experience back pain for one year postpartum.       Those women whose low back pain persists into the postpartum period are more at risk of       experiencing comorbidities such as postpartum depression.        In the extrauterine life maternal pain limits a mothers ability to securely attach with her       child. Furthermore, interpretation of pain intensity is influenced by the type of attachment       the individual has with her parents. Little is known how maternal pain may influence       intrauterine attachment. Similarly, heart rate variability is influenced by pain and by       spinal manipulation in non-pregnant populations. However, normal non-pregnant patterns of       heart rate variability are altered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and       little is known about why this happens or what this means.

Despite the frequency of this complain, there is limited       efforts to evaluate sleep or the abnormal increases in the expression of proinflamatory       cytokines play a key role in the progression of RA, we hypothesize that the cytokine network       is one physiological system that is associated with sleep disturbances in RA patients.       Proinflamatory cytokines signal the central nervous system and are associated with increased       symptoms of pain, fatigue, and depressed mood in rheumatic patients. Moreover, sleep loss is       coincident with alterations in sympathetic tone, which is thought to contribute to increases       of proinflammatory cytokine activity. The specific aims of the study are to examine the       contribution of cytokines on sleep by administering a TNF antagonist vs. placebo to probe       the action of proinflammatory cytokines on sleep in RA Patients. Examination of sleep and       its consequences for autonomic functioning and proinflamatory cytokine activity within the       framework of an observational and experimental research design will have implications for       understanding the psycho-biological mechanisms that link sleep and the clinical       manifestations of RA. Results from this study will guide the developments of interventions       that target disordered sleep with potential effects on disability in RA. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Abnormal sleep is reported by more than half of rheumatoid arthritis patients, in addition       to the traditional symptoms associated with the disease, such as morning stiffness, pain,       and functional debility. When recording brain activity during sleep using       electroencephalography or EEG. Sleep abnormalities have been found independent of pain and       thus the mechanisms to account for disordered sleep in this population are unknown. The       immune system, via pro-inflammatory cytokines, plays a major role in the development of       rheumatoid arthritis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are molecules that act as signals to       stimulate activity of different arms of the immune system. New medications such as remicade       infliximab have been developed which slow disease activity by blocking the activity of       these pro-inflammatory cytokines. This is done by binding to the cytokine TNF and rendering       it biologically inactive. Proinflammatory cytokines also appear to play a role in sleep. A       number of basic and human studies have found that cytokines and sleep exhibit a       bi-directional relationship. However, no study to date has explored this relationship in a       rheumatoid arthritis population. Thus, this research study has the potential to test whether       cytokines influence sleep in rheumatoid arthritis. We will determine if a single dose of a       pro-inflammatory cytokine blocking medication remicade affects sleep in rheumatoid       arthritis patients. Interested participants will undergo an eligibility interview to review       in-depth subject participation, RA diagnosis, written Consent. Following eligibility,       patients will undergo a single overnight sleep assessment lasting four nights at the General       Clinical Research Center. After the adaption and baseline nights, on day 3, patients will be       randomized to receive either 10 mg/kg of remicade or placebo and their sleep will be       subsequently monitored for two additional nights  post-infusion 1 and post-infusion 2.       Participants will then be follow-up for three months after either remicade or placebo       infusions. In this way, the effects of blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines can be examined       for sleep, morning stiffness, pain and fatigue. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1. Rheumatoid arthritis patients will meet American College of Rheumatology revised              criteria Arnett, Edworthy et al. 1988. This requires at least four of the following              seven criteria: 1 morning joint stiffness; 2 arthritis in 3 or more joint areas; 3              arthritis of hand joints; 4 symmetric arthritis; 5 rheumatoid nodules; 6 presence              of serum rheumatoid factor and 7 changes on posteroanterior hand and wrist              radiographs. In addition, criteria 1-4 must be present for at least four weeks.              Subjects must be between 18 and 85 years of age.            2. If rheumatoid arthritis patients are receiving treatment with traditional disease              modifying antirheumatic drugs DMARD, such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine or              hydroxychloroquine, they must be on a stable regime for one month before study and              stable throughout study.            3. If rheumatoid arthritis patients have received treatment with a TNF antagonist or              other biologic medication, they must be drug free for greater than 3 months.          Exclusion Criteria:            1. Steroids - Individuals currently taking greater than an equivalent of 10 mg of              prednisone will be excluded given the potent anti-inflammatory effects of such              medications.            2.

Co-morbid medical disorders - the presence of active unstable and uncontrolled              co-morbid medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer              will be exclusionary criteria. In particular, individuals with co-morbid inflammatory              disorders such as Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune              disorders will be excluded. Any uncontrolled medical condition that is deemed by the              investigators to interfere with the proposed study procedures, or put the study              participant at undue risk will also be considered exclusionary criteria.            4.

Blood transfusions are one       treatment option for ACS. High levels of an enzyme called secretory phospholipase A2 sPLA2       may be present in people before they develop ACS. This study will determine how well sPLA2       levels can predict the onset of ACS and whether identifying high sPLA2 levels allows enough       time to prevent ACS with blood transfusions. Results from this study will help to determine       the feasibility of conducting a larger study that would further examine the use of sPLA2       levels and blood transfusions to prevent ACS in people with SCD. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       SCD is an inherited blood disorder, and symptoms include anemia, infections, organ damage,       and intense episodes of pain, which are called sickle cell crises. ACS, characterized by       fever, respiratory distress, and lung tissue damage, is the second most common cause of       hospitalization and the leading cause of death among people with SCD. Most people with SCD       will experience at least one episode of ACS, and repeated episodes can result in progressive       lung disease. ACS can appear suddenly and often requires immediate hospitalization and       treatment, which can include blood transfusions. People with elevated blood levels of sPLA2       may be at risk for developing ACS, and this enzyme is often detectable before the onset of       ACS symptoms. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of sPLA2 as a predictor of ACS       and to determine whether subsequent blood transfusions can be administered early enough to       prevent the onset of ACS in people with SCD who are at risk for ACS. Study researchers will       also assess the feasibility of conducting a larger study that would further examine the       effectiveness of using sPLA2 levels and blood transfusions to prevent ACS.        This study will involve two parts. In the first part of the study, participants with SCD who       are admitted to the hospital with an acute sickle cell pain event will be randomly assigned       to receive either a single blood transfusion or standard care for ACS and no blood       transfusion. All participants will be closely monitored while in the hospital for the       development of ACS, and study researchers will review participants medical records. All       participants will undergo daily blood collections, which will include testing for sPLA2       levels, and at least two chest x-rays. Twenty-eight days after hospital discharge, all       participants will attend a follow-up study visit for blood collection, again to determine       sPLA2 levels.        In the second part of the study, participants who are not eligible or who do not choose to       participate in the first part of the study will be enrolled into an observational group.       These participants will receive standard care for ACS, but will not receive a blood       transfusion. They will undergo daily blood collection during their hospital stay and at       least one chest x-ray. While participants are in the hospital and 28 days after discharge,       study researchers will review participants medical records.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT00952744","TITLE:       Investigation of the Biomarker Copeptin in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction SUMMARY:       While troponin is not detectable until several hours after an Acute Myocardial Infarction       AMI, copeptin is expected to be elevated very early after an AMI. A combination of both       markers for the diagnosis of AMI early after the event is therefore expected to be       advantageous. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       In patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome ACS such as chest pain or       pressure, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, detection of a rise and/or fall of       troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit is       essential to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction AMI. However, current troponin       testing has limitations, including antibody specificity, assay imprecision, lack of       standardization and a relatively late increase in the circulating troponin level after the       onset of ischemia. Studies have shown a low diagnostic sensitivity of troponins when       measured early <6 hours after symptom onset. Although there are some more sensitive       troponin assays with a coefficient of variation CV10% at the 99th percentile of a normal       reference population, most troponin assays have an imprecision CV of around 20% at the 99th       percentile of the reference population. The early insensitivity of troponin results in an       unmet need in the clinical evaluation of patients presenting with suspected ACS and AMI.        Copeptin may improve early AMI diagnostic sensitivity because of a number of unique       characteristics.          -  Copeptin levels are elevated at presentation in patients with AMI compared to patients            with other presentations.          -  Copeptin levels are elevated in patients with AMI even when troponin levels were not            elevated at the time of initial presentation.          -  Thus, a combination of troponin and copeptin levels at presentation may result in a            more accurate diagnosis of acute AMI than troponin alone.          -  Copeptin levels drop 1 day after an AMI.

The first 3-6 months are the most crucial periods as this is the period of       maximal neurological recovery and neuroplasticity. Differential rates of recovery occur for       various types of impairments post-stroke. In general, motor functions mobility, walking,       upper limb function, activities of daily living ADL recover faster than cognitive or       language impairments which may recover over 12 months. A number of approaches to stroke       injury rehabilitation have been introduced to facilitate intrinsic recovery or aid adaptive       compensation for stroke-related impairments. Generally for rehabilitative training to be       effective, it must be commenced as early as possible after stroke. Current research proves       that rehabilitation using traditional neuro-facilitation approaches is effective in       improving neurological and functional recovery and is superior to no treatment or nursing       care alone. Rehabilitated patients have shorter total hospitalization stays, lower       complication rates, earlier and higher rates of discharge home than patients who do not       receive rehabilitation. In addition, rehabilitation involving a multidisciplinary team       approach led by rehabilitation physician or specialist result in better functional outcomes       compared to acute general ward-based therapies. In order for rehabilitation to be effective       in modifying cortical neuroplasticity, it must be targeted at the specific stroke       impairment, task specific, exercise must be repetitive and intensive, goal directed and       command the attention of the stroke patient. Some of the components of rehabilitation       include physical therapy, gait and balance training, aerobic conditioning, functional       Activities of Daily Living ADL training, physical modalities to treat pain, Functional       Electrical Stimulation FES or Neuro-Muscular Electrical Stimulation NMES. Other methods       include specific treatments to address complications of rehabilitation such as spasticity,       ataxia, contractures and bladder or bowel incontinence. Often, one-to-one and highly       labour-intensive and expensive therapies with close hand-over-hand treatments are required.       Limitations of current physiotherapy and occupational therapy techniques include the       following:1 Difficulties in rehabilitation for the severely paralysed arm and hand which       are often treated with passive modalities such as NMES, passive ROMs and other modalities.       2 Difficulties in achieving intensive rehabilitation and high repetitions in those with       moderate to severe upper extremity paralysis either due to non participation or pain which       is commoner in those with severe paralysis. 3Problems in motivating and sustaining patient       interest in repetitive exercises.4Therapy is often perceived to be boring and due to lack       of immediate biofeedback. I Robot Aided Rehabilitation: MIT USA has developed a robot,       named the MIT-MANUS, to aid therapy of stroke victims. Small clinical trials have reported       that the robot significantly improved patients recovery of arm motor movement and function       with sustained gains several months after cessation of treatment. This system is being       clinically used as a rehabilitation training tool in over 20 centres world-wide. Advantages       of robot aided rehabilitation include the ability to document and store motion and force       parameters, the ability to achieve thousands of repetitions per treatment session 100 times       more than conventional treatment or FES without causing tissue injury or pain, high       intensity with low friction, attention training and increased biofeedback through the       incorporation of interactive video games, which can simulate trajectories, mazes, ADL tasks       such as preparing a meal and spatial task simulation such as going shopping. In addition,       after the initial training period, supervision of the patient by the therapist can be       reduced due to the sustainability of participation of the patient from the robot or BCI       based Robotic Rehabilitation. Hence, productivity of the human therapist is increased by the       robot. The robot thus acts as a high technology aid to the clinician and therapist. The       system is also portable, giving rise to the possibility of tele-rehabilitation options with       the performance and progress of the patient being monitored by the institution remotely.       IIBCI-based BCI based Robotic Rehabilitation:This non invasive device aims to use a novel       approach in robotic training, which has not been employed in the therapeutic realm before.In       the MIT-MANUS and related commercially available systems, there is no direct communication       between the patients mind or thinking processes or motor volitional thinking and the       robotic system. Although some sensors are used to detect the patients weak movement, it       never knows when and how the patient wants to move. The robot arm to which the patient is       tethered or constrained plans the trajectory of movement for the patient and reduces its       active role as the patient recovers voluntary motion. In most times, the patient can only       passively follow the predefined program, which may not fully explore the patients motor       initiatives and potential or attention processes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The patients receiving CRT are medically refractory, symptomatic, NYHA class III or IV       disease and QRS duration of 130 m sec or greater, and a left ventricular ejection fraction       of 30 percent or less.        The pulse wave velocity between carotid and femoral PWVcf will be recorded in each subject       at base line before and after CRT, at one month after AV delay optimization and again at       6 months after CRT. The arterial pulse wave is recorded at a proximal artery, such as the       carotid artery, and as well as at a distal artery, such as the femoral artery. The       superficial location of the carotid and femoral arteries means that their pulse waveforms       are readily measured noninvasively using the M Hz Doppler probe, and between these two sites       the pulse wave has to travel through most of the aorta. The time delay between the arrival       of a predefined part of the pulse wave, such as the foot, at these 2 points is obtained by       gating to the peak of the R-wave of the ECG. The distance traveled by the pulse wave is       measured over the body surface and PWV is then calculated as distance/time m/s.        Clinical evidence of response: Either one or more of the following: 1 Improvement in NYHA       functional classification, 2 Improvement in 6 minute walking distance. 3 Change in       functional class, exercise tolerance while the heart is getting smaller on CXR. 4       Stabilization of patient CHF even without subjective improvement over 6 months remaining       class III rather than progressive to class IV. Imaging evidence of response: 1 Increase in       left ventricular ejection fraction. 2 Reduction of mitral regurgitation. 3 Reduction of LV       volume signifying reverse remodeling. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  The patients receiving CRT are medically refractory, symptomatic, NYHA class III or              IV disease and QRS duration of 130 m sec or greater, and a left ventricular ejection              fraction of 30 percent or less.            -  All individuals are carefully selected after appropriate clinical evaluation as              determined by the treating physicians to exclude possible reversible causes of heart              failure.          Exclusion Criteria:            -  Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and non-palpable carotid and/or femoral              pulses will be excluded due to technical limitations of the procedure used for the              measurement of arterial stiffness.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Objectives of the study          1. To test the accuracy of anatomical and functional non-invasive cardiac imaging in the            diagnosis of IHD. To this purpose the anatomical information provided by CTA is            obtained in every patient together with the functional information provided by stress            radionuclide cardiac imaging SPECT or PET, to assess myocardial perfusion, and/or by            stress MRI or ECHO imaging to assess myocardial contraction. Non-invasive results are            tested against invasive reference standards. The latter consists of invasive coronary            angiography integrated by invasive measurement of fractional flow reserve to assess            the hemodynamic relevance of intermediate coronary stenoses.          2.

SUMMARY:       The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of intra-articular hydraulic distension       IHD for the treatment of painful stiff shoulders between capsule-rupturing and       capsule-preserving IHDs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The Painful stiff shoulder PSS, or the adhesive capsulitis, involves stiff and contracted       joint capsule from fibrosis in the glenohumeral joint. Intra-articular hydraulic distension       IHD enlarges the stiffened capsule by deforming it with excessive volume and pressure       within the joint space. Although IHD is one of the most common treatment options for the       PSS, the diversity of the IHD technique spans wide range. Specifically, it is not generally       agreed as for which, between capsule-rupturing and capsule-preserving IHDs, is superior for       PSS treatment. Capsule-preserving IHD might fail to infuse sufficient amount of fluid to       avoid rupture, thus producing less satisfactory outcomes. However, we devised in our       previous study a novel technique that enabled a physician to infuse the possible largest       volume without rupturing the capsule.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       During pregnancy there is a generally enhanced risk to develop venous thromboembolism VTE.       Although such events are rare they may lead to serious risks for the mothers´ and children´s       health. Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women have an about five-fold risk to       develop VTE.        Due to their characteristic spectrum of side effects and the generally long duration of       exposure in pregnancy the preferred anticoagulants may produce potentially dangerous side       effects, as bleedings, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia HIT, allergic reactions,       osteoporosis, or congenital anomalies.        Today, low-molecular weight heparins LMWH are the preferred agents for anticoagulation in       pregnancy. Compared with unfractioned heparins UFH LMWHs have the advantages of a lower       bleeding risk, a lower rate of allergic reactions and HIT, a more predictable response and a       longer half-life that makes dosing more convenient od or bid.        Still, there is a considerable proportion of pregnancies where heparin intolerance allergic       reactions or HIT that make it inevitable to change to another anticoagulant.        On the one hand, fondaparinux has repeatedly been reported successful in the VTE prophylaxis       of pregnancies where allergic reactions on heparins, or heparinoids, had occurred.       Additionally, a considerable amount of oral reports have reached GSK about an additional       number of successful cases in the past.        On the other hand, we have no systematic and overall view about how many pregnancies have       already been treated for which reasons, and how successful they were. Due to an increase of       certain risk factors, as obesity or the growing age of mothers at childbirth with the       associated need for anticoagulation, we expect an increased number of cases where       alternative anticoagulation to heparins may be needed.        There are a number of potential advantages of fondaparinux over heparins, such as a once       daily application, no dose adjustment needed to body weight and no monitoring of       thrombocytes, a lower potential for causing intolerance reactions and no risk for HIT.        The objective of this retrospective study is to gather information about how fondaparinux is       used pre-, peri- and/or postpartum for both the prophylaxis and treatment of VTE in order to       fill an information gap concerning the off-label use of fondaparinux during pregnancy.

Minority and lower-income adults have among the highest obesity rates and lowest       levels of regular PA. Increasing environmental supports for safe and convenient places for       PA is an emerging public health strategy for PA interventions. Preliminary data by Wilson       PI and colleagues has revealed through focus groups that low-income minority adults would       like to increase the safe places for PA areas free from crime, containment of stray dogs,       increased police patrol and access to PA sidewalks/trails and expand opportunities for PA       in their community. In addition, the results of the investigators preliminary studies       suggest that African Americans had psychosocial barriers to PA that included lack of       self-motivation, cultural body image issues, and lack of time due to family obligations. The       present proposal is innovative in that it specifically tests the efficacy of an intervention       that includes both patrolled-walking and social marketing elements to increase PA in       low-income African Americans. Three communities will be randomized to receive one of three       programs: a police patrolled-walking program plus social marketing intervention, a police       patrolled-walking only intervention, or no walking intervention general health education       only; N=390; 130/group. The 24-month intervention will focus on increasing safety training       community leaders to serve as walking captains, hiring off-duty police officers to patrol       the walking program, and containing stray dogs, increasing access for PA marking a walking       route, and will include a tailored social marketing campaign for increasing PA in one       intervention community. The investigators will collect data for PA 7-day accelerometer       estimates, 4-week PA history, body composition, blood pressure, psychosocial measures, and       perceptions of environmental supports for safety and access for PA at baseline, 6-,12-,18-,       and 24-months. The primary hypotheses are that the patrolled-walking plus social marketing       intervention will result in greater increases in moderate and vigorous PA as compared to a       patrolled walking only intervention or no-intervention by 12-months and that these effects       will be maintained at 18-month and 24-month assessments.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Approximately 16,000-39,000 persons come in contact with potentially rabid animals and       receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis PEP each year in the US. To appropriately manage       potential human exposures to rabies, the risk for infection must be accurately assessed.       Administration of rabies PEP is a medical urgency, not a medical emergency, but decisions       must not be delayed. Prophylaxis is occasionally complicated by adverse reactions, but these       reactions are rarely severe. Current data on the safety and efficacy of active and passive       rabies vaccination were derived from both human and animal studies. Timely and appropriate       human pre-exposure prophylaxis Pre-EP and PEP will prevent human rabies. Currently in the       US, the approved dosage and administration for PEP in previously unvaccinated persons       consists of the administration of vaccine HDCV or PCECV and HRIG. Vaccine is administered       IM on days 0, 3, 7, 21, and 28 deltoid area. The approved dosage and administration for       pre-exposure prophylaxis Pre-EP consists of three 1.0-mL injections of vaccine HDCV or       PCECV administered IM deltoid area, one injection per day on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28.       Intradermal ID route of administration of rabies vaccination is used in certain countries       both for PEP and Pre-EP, and approved by WHO for modern potent cell culture vaccines. Recent       studies outside the USA found the use of PCEC rabies vaccine by ID administration       immunogenic and safe.        The primary goals of this study are to obtain additional safety and immunogenicity data on       ID administration of 0.1 mL doses of the inactivated PCEC rabies virus vaccine in adults.       Given the need to provide alternative routes of administration to the current approved       intramuscular route in order to protect a larger number of people facing potential vaccine       shortages. The data yielded by this clinical trial will provide evidence to support       alternative route of administration and dose of PCECV in the US.

Uncontrolled- UH and resistant hypertension RHare       more common in patients with type-II-DM, why further bloodpressure BP control is needed.        The prevalence of UH and RH has not been examined in a consecutive Danish outpatient       population with type-II-DM.        The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of resistant hypertension in patients       with type-II-diabetes and to examine the characteristics of patients with resistant       hypertension as compared to patients with controlled hypertension with regards to arterial       stiffness. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The risk of cardiovascular disease CVD in patients with type-II- diabetes mellitus       type-II-DM is more than doubled and CVD accounts for 70% of deaths in this group of       patients. Hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD in patients with type-II-DM with a       major increase in diabetes-related death as a result. Controlled hypertension as well as       uncontrolled- and resistant hypertension is more common in patients with type-II-DM than in       the general population and are major contributors to CVD and cardiovascular mortality.        Resistant hypertension is defined as BP above 130 mmHg systolic and / or 80 mmHg diastolic       despite treatment with 3 antihypertensive agents or more, of which one should be a diuretic,       or controlled BP on four antihypertensive agents or more.        The NHANES study estimated the prevalence of hypertension in patients with type-II-DM to 71%       and showed that among those with type-II-DM and hypertension only 31% had controlled BP. It       is furthermore estimated that resistant that hypertension is present in up to 30% of a       hypertensive population and the ALLHAT trial found that 50% of hypertensives needed       treatment with three or more antihypertensive agents.        Type-II-DM promotes both small and large artery disease, whereas hypertension promotes       primarily large artery disease. As such type-II-DM and hypertension together may influence       the entire vascular system. Type-II-DM is strongly associated with development of heart       failure and atherosclerosis and it is therefore important to investigate parameters that       reflect arterial stiffness AS, left ventricular function and degree of atherosclerosis.        AS is an age dependent process, where the arterial wall degenerate and elastic fibers are       replaced by collagen fibers. The process is accelerated by cardiac risk factors and       increased AS can be regarded as both an individual risk factor and a marker reflecting       atherosclerosis.        AS can be estimated by pulse wave analysis PWA including pulse wave velocity PWV.        As blood is pumped out of the heart, a pulse wave is created. The pulse wave propagates       along the vessels and is reflected from the arterial wall at sites of increased impedance.       In healthy elastic arteries the reflected wave reaches the aorta during diastole resulting       in increased coronary perfusion. In stiff arteries the reflected wave propagates faster and       reaches the aorta during systole before closure of the aortic valve, thereby increasing       pulse pressure, systolic pressure and reducing diastolic pressure and thereby coronary       perfusion.        Augmentation Index AIx measured using PWA is related to ischemic heart disease IHD risk       factors, among other hypertension and diabetes, and is an independent predictor of mortality       in patients with IHD. It is therefore important to examine the relationship between BP and       AS, as it may characterize the patients with uncontrolled and resistant hypertension.        A consequence of increased AS is left ventricular hypertrophy LVH and a common       echocardiographic finding in patients with hypertension, type-II-DM and LVH, is diastolic       dysfunction. This is often seen before the onset of systolic dysfunction and any symptoms of       CVD.        Coronary artery calcium CAC score is closely related to atherosclerosis and is a number       reflecting the degree and extent of calcium deposits in the walls of the coronary arteries,       as demonstrated by cardiac computed tomography. CAC score represents overall plaque burden       and is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular events CVE and cardiovascular death       in asymptomatic patients. In patients with type-II-DM the extent of CAC score is similar to       that of patients with coronary artery disease CAD. Measurement of CAC score can be used as       advanced risk assessment. As CAC score is high in patients with cardiac risk factors it is       possible that CAC score is reduced when minimizing cardiac risk factors.        The relationship between BP, AS and left ventricular function score may provide further       methods of risk stratification and new strategies for treatment of uncontrolled and       resistant hypertension in patients with type-II-DM.        Hypothesis          1. Uncontrolled and resistant hypertension is present in more than 50% of consecutive            patients with type-II-DM in an out-patient clinic.          2. Increased AS, diastolic dysfunction and high CAC score are more common in patients with            type-II-DM with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension than in patients with controlled            BP.          3. AS, diastolic function and CAC are improved with increased control of BP.        To test these hypotheses we wish to conduct two studies:          1. A descriptive study in which the prevalence of uncontrolled and resistant hypertension            in consecutive out-patients with type-II-DM is assessed.          2.

ACE527 is a vaccine that is being made to prevent disease from a germ called enterotoxigenic       Escherichia coli ETEC. This germ causes diarrhea, largely in children living in developing       countries and in travelers to those countries. One purpose of this study is to see if the       vaccine is safe and develops an immune response. Another purpose is to see if it prevents       people from getting sick when exposed to the ETEC germ. This ETEC germ is also experimental       investigational. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II vaccination and       challenge study designed to assess the protective efficacy of the ACE 527 vaccine, as well       as collect expanded safety and immunogenicity data. The study will be carried out in two       phases. In the initial vaccination phase, up to 72 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to       receive either ACE527 or placebo on an outpatient basis. Vaccine and placebo preparations       will be given orally. Following vaccination, subjects will be followed as out-patients for       safety using diary card surveillance, for vaccine shedding by qualitative stool culture       i.e. presence or absence and for the development of local and systemic antibody responses       to the ACE527 vaccine strains. In the subsequent inpatient challenge phase, up to 56       vaccinated subjects will be admitted as inpatients and challenged with the ETEC strain,       H10407. The challenge dose will be administered orally.After challenge, subjects will be       monitored for diarrhea and other signs/symptoms of enteric illness by daily medical checks,       vital sign determinations, grading and weighing of all stools. Monitoring for fecal shedding       of the challenge ETEC strain H10407 will occur daily, after challenge, while in-patient.       Local and systemic antibody responses to the challenge ETEC strain H10407 will also be       assessed. All subjects will be treated with Abx.

The hope is that the results of this study will validate tools help prove that       diagnostic tools actually detect disease for the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain       injuries TBI. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Normal appearing brain is often not normal when imaged with advanced neuroimaging       techniques. It has been advocated that a battery of neurological assessments including MEG       be developed to assess mild traumatic brain injury TBI and studies have shown that       somatosensory evoked fields in severe TBI can serve as a measure of cortical function in       comatosed TBI patients. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as PET and fMRI may reveal       abnormalities in areas considered normal on traditional MRI. Most significantly, advanced       functional neuroimaging may enable customized neurorehabilitation planning with more       efficient use of resources.        The study aim is to compare healthy brains, civilian TBI brains, and combat-related TBI to       identify correlations between abnormal imaging parameters with neurorehabilitation potential       utilizing advanced neurological imaging.        The study hypothesis states Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury TBI and Post-traumatic       Stress Disorders PTSD can be detected and quantified using a multimodal battery of       neurodiagnostic imaging techniques MEG, PET/CT, 3 Tesla-MRI w/ DTI and fMRI and       rehabilitation potential can be predicted in the post acute phase.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01075269","TITLE:       Postoperative Distress and Cosmetic Outcomes After Open Versus Robotic Thyroidectomy SUMMARY:       Robotic assistance during thyroid surgery has been utilized clinically in Korea since late       2007. Robotic thyroidectomy has also been validated for surgical management of the thyroid       gland. Compared with endoscopic thyroidectomy, the use of a robot in an endoscopic approach       via the axilla provides a broader view of the thyroid bed, albeit from a lateral, as opposed       to the conventional anterior, perspective. The wrist action of a surgical robot also       provides a greater degree of movement than afforded by the use of simple endoscopic       instruments, and tremor is eliminated.        Although several reports on operative outcomes of the robotic technique have appeared, no       prospective trials comparing the clinical results of robotic with conventional open       thyroidectomy have been described. We therefore designed a prospective trial comparing       outcomes, including postoperative distress and patient satisfaction, between patients       undergoing robotic and conventional open thyroidectomy. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Patient assessment A prospective study addressing perioperative outcomes and postoperative       patient discomfort after thyroidectomy was commenced in April 2009 and is currently       continuing. All patients were told about the operative techniques involved in conventional       open and robotic thyroidectomy, and patients subsequently chose their preferred surgical       procedure, voluntarily agreed to participate in our study, and provided written informed       consent. The study protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board.        Patients were included if they had a a minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma ≤4       cm in diameter, or b a papillary thyroid carcinoma ≤2 cm in diameter. Exclusion criteria       included a previous neck operations; b age <21 or >65 years; c prior vocal fold       paralysis or a history of voice or laryngeal disease requiring therapy; d a malignancy       with definite extrathyroid invasion, multiple lateral neck node metastasis, perinodal       infiltration at a metastatic lymph node, or distant metastasis; and/or e a lesion located       in the thyroid dorsal area especially adjacent to the tracheoesophageal groove caused by       possible injury to the trachea, esophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerve RLN. The extent of       thyroid resection was determined for each patient using American Thyroid Association       guidelines. All patients underwent prophylactic ipsilateral central compartment node       dissection CCND; pretracheal, prelaryngeal, and paraesophageal.        Surgical outcomes Surgical outcomes included operating time, intraoperative blood loss,       number of retrieved central lymph nodes, length of hospital stay, and postoperative       complications. We also assessed the incidence of postoperative seromas and hematomas for at       least 3 weeks postoperatively. Operating time was defined as the interval from skin incision       to closure. The drainage extent was measured over 24 h, and a drain was removed if drainage       was <30 mL in this interval. Study patients were discharged the day after drain removal.        Mobility of the vocal cords was assessed by videostrobolaryngoscopic examination, performed       both preoperatively and 1 week and 3 months postoperatively. Vocal cord palsy was defined as       permanent when there was no evidence of recovery within 6 months.        Postoperative pain and cosmetic outcomes To evaluate the degree of postoperative pain, all       patients were given analgesics on an identical protocol. Patients were asked to grade       postoperative pain in the neck and anterior chest as none, very slight, slight, moderate, or       severe, 24 h after surgery.        At 1 week and 3 months after surgery, patients were asked by questionnaire to evaluate the       presence of hyperesthesia and paresthesia in the neck and anterior chest, as well as       shoulder discomfort. All patients answered and returned completed questionnaires.        Cosmetic results, including wound appearance and complaints, were evaluated by patients 3       months after surgery using a verbal response scale with five possible responses: extremely       satisfied, excellent, acceptable, dissatisfied, and extremely dissatisfied.        Subjective voice and swallowing evaluation We used the Voice Handicap Index-10 VHI-10, a       validated, reliable self-assessment tool that measures patient assessment of voice quality       and the effect of voice on quality-of-life, to determine the frequency of voice       abnormalities. The VHI-10 consists of 10 questions, responses to each of which are scaled       from a minimum of 0 no voice alteration to a maximum of 40 highest voice impairment.        Swallowing difficulties were assessed using the Swallowing Impairment Index SIS-6, a       self-administered, six-item assessment of symptoms related to dysphagia that has been       validated for diagnosis of impairment. The scoring of each item on the SIS-6 ranges from a       minimum of 0 no swallowing alteration to a maximum of 24 highest swallowing impairment.       The SIS-6 score is also excellent for assessing non-voice throat symptoms, including cough,       choking, and throat-clearing, all of which occur after thyroidectomy. All patients enrolled       in this study completed the VHI-10 and SIS-6 questionnaires before surgery and at 1 week and       3 months after surgery.

Low zinc levels are associated with an increased atherosclerotic burden.       Therefore we hypothesized that patients with pathological stress test would have low levels       of Vitamin D and zinc compared to patients with a normal stress test. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Hypovitaminosis D is generally defined as 25OHD levels of < 20ng/ml, while levels of       21-29ng/ml indicate insufficiency and those above 30ng/ml are regarded as sufficient.        The rational behind the observations associating vitamin D deficiency with CVD is that on       the one hand, hypovitaminosis D was found to be associated with traditional risk factors       such as hypertension HTN,diabetes mellitus dm,obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic       syndrome , on the other hand, experimental data demonstrated that vitamin D could affect       cardiac muscle cells directly, control parathyroid PTH hormone secretion, regulate the       rennin- angiotensin- aldosterone system and the immune system, all of which could influence       cardiovascular risk.        Epidemiological studies further support this association, demonstrating high prevalence of       hypovitaminosis D among U.S. adults with cardiovascular disease 74%. An association       between low vitamin D levels and increased myocardial infarction risk as well as total       mortality has been also observed.

Eligible patients: All critically ill children will be considered eligible for this research       project if they fulfill all the following criteria :          -  The patients should be PICU-hospitalized          -  Child under mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube for at least 12 hours, as            estimated by the attending intensivist.          -  Child below 18 years of age, with a body weight ≥ 3 kg.        Screening of eligible patients: The attending Pediatric Intensivist and a Research Nurse       will check for candidates on a daily basis in the pediatric intensive care unit PICU of       Sainte-Justine Hospital HSJ. An eligibility screening log, documenting the subjects       fulfillment of the entry criteria, will be completed for all eligible patients considered       for the study, regardless of their subsequent inclusion or exclusion status Bookkeeping.       Consent will be solicited from parents or legal guardians if a patient fulfils eligibility       criteria and presents no exclusion criteria.        Inclusion and exclusion Criteria see below        Baseline data:        All subjects included into this study will undergo routine examination upon admission to the       hospital. These examinations include physical, medical/medication history on the last year       for medical history and the last 3 months for medication history if available, vital       signs, radiologic data and laboratory tests. Assessment of these data will occur in       potential candidates within 24 hours of their hospitalization. BMI Body Mass Index will be       derived from the subjects height and weight. PIM 2 and PELOD scores will be computed the       PIM 2 score is a mortality risk score for children, and the PELOD score is a scale       estimating the severity of cases of multiple organ.        Measurements:        Set and measured ventilatory parameters, SpO2 and ETPCO2 will be stored in the S1       ventilator. SpO2 will be measured via pulse oximetry placed on infants extremities in       addition to usual monitoring during the 5 hours of the study. End Tidal PCO2 measurements       will also be made via probe placed on the Y piece of the respirator circuit usual practice       during the 5 hours of the study.        General protocol sequence:          -  All patients in the PICU at HSJ screened daily for eligibility          -  Eligible cases reviewed with attending team and study team          -  Informed consent obtained from parents or guardian          -  Pressure support test A pre-inclusion test pressure support test with a level of            pressure support of ± 5 cmH2O of the previous level of positive inspiratroy pressure in            the controlled mode PCV for instance, but no greater than 30 cmH2O pressure-support            level plus positive end-expiratory pressure, is performed to evaluate if the patients            is ready to be weaned. The test could be stopped before 30 minutes if the patient            showed evidence of respiratory distress respiratory rate > 40 breaths per minute and            FiO2 > 60% in order to obtain pulse oxymetry ≥ 95% or apnea. The test will be            performed again the day after if he still reach inclusion/exclusion criteria. The test            is considered positive when, after 30 minutes, the patient remained clinically stable            with a respiratory rate between 10 and 40 breaths per minute and an expiratory tidal            volume higher than 6 ml per kilogram of body weight within the authorized            pressure-support range, with pulse oxymetry no lower than 95 percent when the fraction            of inspired oxygen was no greater than 60 percent. When the pressure-support test is            positive, the patient is included in the study.          -  Data registered 1 hour in pressure support mode with the ventilator and settings of the            pre-inclusion test.          -  Ventilation is switched to S1 ventilator and the routine ventilator is kept in the            patient room.          -  Application of 3 hours with the S1 ventilator with the following initial settings:        At the study beginning, the S1 ventilator will be implemented and the settings used will be:          -  ASV mode with % minute volume MV set as compared to the mean patients MV measured            during the 1 hour pressure support before          -  PEEP: same as in conventional ventilation          -  FIO2: same as in conventional ventilation After 1 hour, the CO2 removal ECP is started            and 1 hour later, the O2 delivery ECP is started for 1 hour figure 3.               -  Return to routine ventilator with the settings used at inclusion and registered                 during 1 hour A physician or respiratory therapist trained to use S1 ventilator                 will stay during the whole period 5 hours next to the patient.        Monitoring during conventional ventilation after discontinuation of S1 ventilator 1 hour:        In order to compare S1 ventilator to conventional ventilation, monitoring will be continued       with conventional settings on the usual ventilator for 1 hour. Following this, the study       will be stopped and patient back to conventional ventilator unless attending physician       decides to extubate the patient.        Protocol termination criteria: If the child demonstrates a sustained change in any of the       following, the protocol will be terminated and the child ventilated with the previous       conventional ventilation:          -  Sustained decrease in SaO2 < 92% requiring increase in FIO2 > 60%          -  ETPCO2 > ETPCO2 at S1 start requiring increase of positive inspiratory pressure > 25            cmH2O above PEEP,          -  Sustained increase in heart rate > 180 bpm during 15 min,          -  Sustained increase in respiratory rate > 60 bpm during 15 min,          -  Uncontrolled agitation judged by the attending physician        Management of protocol termination episodes:        All protocol termination episodes will be analyzed by two pediatric intensivists non       involved in the research project François Proulx MD, France Gauvin MD. We do not expect       any safety issue while performing this research project, but there is few experience with       the S1 ventilator under study, which explain why we will so closely watch for any problem       attributable to S1 ventilator.        Analysis and statistics Data will be described as n, mean, median, standard deviation,       minimum and maximum for quantitative variables and frequencies for qualitative variables.       The percentage of time in normal breathing range and normal saturation range will be       compared between the last hour with S1 ventilator, and the first hour in conventional       ventilation; and between the last hour with S1 ventilator and last hour in conventional       ventilation 2 groups using a Wilcoxons test.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01098851","TITLE:       Oxygen Saturation Monitoring During Surgery SUMMARY:       Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea OSA have cyclical patterns of lower blood oxygen       during sleep because of repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction that cause their       breathing to stop. When these patients have surgery, anesthetic drugs may worsen these       patterns of lower blood oxygen. This study monitors ten patients at high risk for OSA and       ten patients at low risk for OSA during surgery. Patterns of lower oxygen saturations should       arise in the high risk group but not the low risk group. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea OSA have episodes of upper airway obstruction during       sleep which have been shown to be accompanied by multiple oxygen desaturations followed by       short recovery intervals until rising PaCO2 causes sleep disruption/rescue arousal. In the       postoperative and conscious sedation arena, these patterns can deteriorate from a stable       pattern to a severely unstable pattern which may go unrecognized and lead to an adverse       event respiratory/cardiac arrest; death.        Anesthesia and the higher consumption of analgesics produce a profound reduction in       pharyngeal tone, a dampening of both chemoreceptor sensitivity and arousal/rescue response.       Thus the first 48 hours post operatively presents a vulnerable period. Respiratory       disturbances are more prominent - respiratory arrest and hypopnea being the main adverse       occurrences during this period.        An algorithm has been developed that monitors saturation and indicates repetitive reductions       in airflow through the upper airway and into the lungs. Presence of this pattern in the       procedural sedation patient population has not been tested for its prevalence. This study       will monitor patients during surgery to determine if this pattern occurs in this hospital       setting.

Patients with diabetes are 22 times more likely to have foot ulceration or gangrene            than nondiabetics，while foot ulceration precedes 85% of lower-extremity amputation.          -  Three factors combine to promote tissue necrosis in diabetic feet: ischemia, neuropathy            and trauma. Among them, ischemia peripheral arterial disease may play the important            roles in the development of DFU. Moreover, diffuse vascular disease is the main            characteristics, and thus it becomes difficult for treatment by using arterial bypass            or balloon angioplasty. Therefore, we hypothesized that continuous arterial            thrombolysis may be an effective therapy in diabetic foot. The purpose of this study is            to investigate the effectiveness and safety of continuous intra-femoral artery            injection of urokinase by micro-artery-pump in diabetic ulcers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       -  We select 200 diabetic patients with Wagner grade 1 ~ 3 foot ulcers. They are divided            into two groups randomly: thrombolysis group and control group, 100 cases in each            group.          -  After diabetic dietary advice, all patients receive insulin therapy to control blood            glucose within a range of 5 - 10 mmol/L. Then the patients receive conventional care            for their ulcers. To remove extensive callus and necrotic tissue, wound debridement was            performed. Broad spectrum antibiotics are prescribed if ulcers show clinical signs of            infection. Adjustments to the treatment are performed when indicated on the basis of            microbiologic cultures and sensitivity testing.          -  The conventional group patients receive an intravenous injection of prostaglandin E1            20 ug per dayuntil the healing of ulcers or discharged from hospital. In the            continuous intra-femoral thrombolysis group, first of all, a ultrasound Doppler            examination of vessels including artery and venous of lower limbs were performed. To            avoid pulmonary infarction, a filtrator is placed in the inferior vena cava before the            thrombolysis process if ultrasound results show venous thrombosis. Then insert a            percutaneous artery canal from femoral artery in another lower limb into the distal of            popliteal artery as far as possible. After finishing this process, the outside part of            this artery canal is fixed at thigh, and the patients must keep in supine position in            the bed.Firstly,20 0000 ~ 40 0000 units urokinase is injected via the catheter to            diseased foot. Then, continuous infusion urokinase via femoral artery by an artery pump            100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride + 100 0000 unit urokinase at a rate of 4 ml per one hour            for 7 - 10 days. Finally, patients receive an intravenous injection of prostaglandin E1            20 ug per dayuntil the healing of ulcers or discharged from hospital.          -  The healing rate of foot ulcers, the time of ulcers, neuropathy symptoms, the period of            hospitalization are compared between the two groups during hospitalization.          -  The recurrence rate of foot ulcers, cardiovascular events, death from all causes are            compared between two groups at 1, 4, 8 years during follow up.

Procedures are performed under general anesthetic and involve       inserting a catheter through the skin and into the femoral vein or artery in the groin. In       addition, the use of local anesthetic as a pain control regimen just prior to the removal of       femoral artery or vein sheaths is used by some but not all cardiac interventionalists. Local       anesthetic is infiltrated near the sheath insertion site, at the end of the procedure while       the child is under general anesthetic, with the goal of decreasing pain at the insertion       site and promoting comfort in the post-operative period. The use of local anesthetic depends       on the choice of the individual practitioner and is not currently a routine practice for all       patients.        The investigators proposed research seeks to investigate whether the use of subcutaneous       bupivacaine reduces pain levels in the post-operative period in children having cardiac       catheterization procedures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       A number of differences in pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures exist that limit the       transferability of research findings from the adult literature. For example, the majority of       pediatric cardiac catheterizations are performed under general anesthetic, and femoral       sheaths are removed while under general anesthetic and at the end of the procedure. In       contrast in adult clinical practice, procedures are not performed under general anesthetic,       and femoral sheaths are removed when patients are awake and often 4 to 6 hours after the end       of the procedure. These differences limit the ability to apply research findings in adults       to pediatrics, warranting further study of the effects of local anesthetic on femoral site       pain in children. As well, studies in adults have examined pain only up to 20 minutes after       sheath removal. We seek to investigate the impact of bupivacaine up to 6 hours after cardiac       catheterization in children. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01162343","TITLE:       Delirium in the Emergency Department: Novel Screening SUMMARY:       Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by altered or fluctuating mental       status, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or an altered level of consciousness.       This form of organ dysfunction occurs in up to 10% of older emergency department ED       patients and is associated with worsening mortality, prolonged hospital length of stay,       higher health care costs, and accelerated functional and cognitive decline. Despite the       negative consequences of delirium, the majority of cases are unrecognized by emergency       physicians because it is not routinely screened for. In an effort to facilitate delirium       screening, the investigators sought to validate three brief delirium assessments in the ED       setting. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Delirium is often missed because emergency physicians do not routinely screen for this       diagnosis. Most delirium assessments can take up to 10 minutes to perform making them less       likely to be incorporated into the routine physician assessment. Using brief <2 minutes       and easy to use delirium assessments may ameliorate this quality of care issue. The       Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit CAM-ICU possesses these       characteristics, but has only been validated in mechanically and non-mechanically ventilated       intensive care unit patients. Recently, the investigators also developed the Brief Confusion       Assessment Method B-CAM which is a modification of the CAM-ICU. The benefit is that it       takes even less time than the CAM-ICU. The investigators also developed the Emergency       Department Delirium Triage Screen ED-DTS designed to be highly sensitive and moderately       specific delirium assessment for the nurses triage assessment. It is hypothesized that a       negative ED-DTS would rule out delirium, while a positive ED-DTS would require a more formal       delirium assessment such as the CAM-ICU and B-CAM. These new delirium assessments require       validation in older ED patients. As result, the investigators propose the following and the       following specific aims:        Aim #1: To validate the B-CAM in older ED patients. The B-CAM will be performed by a       clinical trials associate CTA and principal investigator in 200 ED patients that are > 65       years old. This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrists Diagnostic and       Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment as the       reference standard.        Aim #2: To validate the CAM-ICU in older ED patients. The CAM-ICU will be performed by a       clinical trials associate CTA and principal investigator in approximately 200 ED patients       that are > 65 years old. This instrument will be validated against a psychiatrists       Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th. Edition Text Revision assessment       as the reference standard.        Aim #3: To validate the ED-DTS in older ED patients. The ED-DTS will be performed by a       clinical trials associate CTA and principal investigator in 200 ED patients that are > 65       years old.

Endothelial       shear stress is predictive factor of clinical outcomes in patients with obstructive       stenosis.        The present study aims at comparing the re-distribution of shear stress and blood velocity       during whole cardiac cycle after trans-coronary injection of Nicardipine and esmolol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Blood flow-induced endothelial shear stress has strong effect on endothelial function and       development or progression of plaque formation. It is extensively accepted that low and/or       oscillating shear stress causes endothelial dysfunction and is one of crucial factors in       localizing early atherosclerosis .In contrary, normal and high shear stress is atheroma       protective and is involved in compensatory remodeling . Most studies reported that the       endothelial shear stress distribution in often idealized geometrical models of human       coronary arteries was the subject of numerous investigations , and in these studies it was       shown that the geometry of coronary arteries is the main determinant of the observed shear       stress distribution. Generally, downstream of a plaque, low shear stress can be expected,       Several cardiovascular active drugs have been shown to be cardio-protective for patients       with obstructive coronary disease. Of these drugs, calcium channel blocker is one of most       prescribed in everyday clinical practice. Ninomiya et al. reported calcium channel blocker       was associated with increased coronary diameter and blood fluid with dose-dependent pattern       in patients with normal or mild stenotic coronary artery. However, no reports on the dynamic       change of endothelial shear stress after calcium channel blocker in -vitron were published       so far. As a result, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intra-venous       injection of Nicardipine, one calcium channel blocker with shorter half-time, on the       re-distribution of endothelial shear stress in patients with acute coronary syndrome and       mild stenotic <50% coronary artery disease.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Thyroid disorder can be central, caused by a deficiency in thyroid stimulating hormone TSH       production; or peripheral, caused by the decrease in the plasma concentration of thyroid       hormones, more specifically of free thyroxine free T4. Peripheral hypothyroidism is caused       by the decrease in the production capacities of the thyroid gland.        The treatment of hypothyroidism is based on the restoration and maintenance of biological       judged on the basis of the standardised TSH and T4 values and clinical euthyroidism.        A number of forms of thyroid hormones are available in the French market Euthyral®,       Cynomel®, L-thyroxine drops®, of which, Levothyrox® is the most frequently prescribed drug       in this category.        The treatment of peripheral hypothyroidism, in particular, is well codified and almost       consensual. In France, there is no published observational study, based on which one can       document the manner in which subjects are treated.

Moreover PTSD is associated with       increased rates of medical morbidity, poor health-related quality of life, and functional       impairment. PTSD is prevalent in primary care settings after road traffic accident, where       approximately 25% of patients meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Despite the       development of a number of efficacious behavioral and pharmacological treatments, only a       minority of patients with PTSD receive mental health services. PTSD is frequently       underrecognized and untreated in Emergency Department and Surgical Unit.        Then, early diagnosis and prevention of PTSD might help to identify patients with PTSD high       risk and lead them to benefit of personalized cares. Nevertheless it is not possible       neither useful to provide psychological cares for each road traffic accident victim.        This is the reason why we think that nurses can help to screen patients who need treatment       for PTSD Hypothesis : Recognition of specific clinical or biological signs occurring during       road traffic accident victim hospitalization in surgical unit could allow beginning specific       treatment using consultation liaison psychiatry.        Early treatment could allow decreasing incidence of psychotraumatic disorders, increasing       surgical functional efficacy and improve convalescence programs.

Calcium Channel blocker CCB       is also commonly used for blood pressure and anginal control in these patients.       Dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blocker e.g. amlodipine inhibits this enzyme.       There are observational studies reporting dihydropyridine CCB reducing clopidogrel effect,       but the clinical implication is unclear.        This study test the hypothesis that there is no significant effect of dihydropyridines CCB       on clopidogrel response compared with control. After giving consent, patients with       suboptimal blood pressure or anginal control will be randomized to receive either       dihydropyridine CCB or non-CCB as placebo. These patient will be follow-up in 1 month. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Clopidogrel is a pro-drug, which requires hepatic transformation by the cytochrome P450       isoform 3A4 to generate the active metabolite. It inhibits adenosine-5-diphosphate       ADP-induced platelet aggregation by irreversibly blocking the platelet P2Y12 receptor.       However, response to clopidogrel shows wide individual variability, and patients with high       on-treatment residual ADP-induced platelet reactivity are at an increased risk of adverse       cardiovascular events. Previous study suggest co-administration of CCBs is associated with       decreased platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, but these observational studies are confounded       by patients characteristics baseline difference such as proportion of hypertension and       diabetes.

These drugs are known to improve survival in many cancers,       including cancers of the colon, stomach, liver, breast, kidney, and GI stromal tumors       GIST. Worldwide, over 400,000 patients per year are treated with one of these agents. HFS       involves skin changes, such as swelling, peeling, and blistering of the palms and soles,       which is often painful and debilitating. As a result, HFS-related symptoms can frequently       lead to dose reduction and/or discontinuation of otherwise effective anti-cancer treatment.       There is no treatment for HFS other than dose reduction or stopping treatment. This proposal       could quickly lead to treatments to prevent and/or treat HFS and help patients avoid       debilitating side effects while continuing otherwise effective treatments for their cancer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The primary objective is to evaluate whether topical sildenafil reduces the severity of hand       foot syndrome or palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia PPE associated with sunitinib and       capecitabine. The secondary objective is to describe any toxicities associated with topical       sildenafil.        This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of topical sildenafil for       patients with grade 1-3 hand foot syndrome related to chemotherapeutic agents.        Approximately 20 evaluable patients with grade 1-3 PPE will be treated with topical       sildenafil:          -  10 patients with PPE related to sunitinib          -  10 patients with PPE related to capecitabine        Once eligibility and screening criteria are met, subjects will be given 2 types of topical       cream, one containing 1% sildenafil citrate and one containing placebo control. Subjects       will be randomized to apply sildenafil citrate cream to either the right or left hand/foot;       placebo cream will be applied to the opposite hand/ foot.        Clinical history, physical examination and photography of the hands and feet will be       performed every two weeks for the first 2 months for patients on sunitinib and then every       4-6 weeks thereafter. For patients on capecitabine which is given on an every 3 week       schedule, these evaluations will be done every 3 weeks. Additional visits may be performed       if clinically indicated.        If PPE resolves, less frequent administration and lower doses will be permitted to maintain       responses. For consistency, patients may first reduce treatment to twice per day at the dose       at which the PPE resolved. If this dosing schedule is effective then lower concentrations,       e.g. 0.5%, may be used.        Patient cream assignment will be un-blinded at the 8 or 9 week time period depending on the       chemotherapy. However, patients with a 2 grade improvement in PPE in one hand versus the       other e.g. grade 3 improves to grade 1, or grade 2 improves to grade 0 that is maintained       for at least 2 weeks, will be eligible for early un-blinding and treatment with active       sildenafil for both hands and both feet.        Patients may receive topical sildenafil for up to 6 months on study.

Unfortunately, despite a number of medical advances, diagnostic       procedure, or epidemiological studies, the treatment of these patients remain complex, and       and at times frustrating. In fact, the COURAGE trial conducted in 50 centers across United       States and Canada documented that drug treatment, coronary interventions or both were not       effective solution in coronary artery diseases.        A novel approach has recently been developed, based on the critical role of the potassium       K content in red-blood-cell in myocardial oxygenation, since oxygen and K binding by       hemoglobin red-blood-cell occurs simultaneously in blood passing through the lungs,       whereas in the organs as the heart, the hemoglobin release both Oxygen and K ions.        This apparently simple mechanisms occurs in human blood in all individuals but could be       altered in subjects with acquired or hereditable defect in red-blood-cell K content. The       purpose of this trial, thus, will be to evaluate the pharmacological effects of Amiloride on       RBC K-uptake and transport and its impact on reversion of angina, electrocardiographic       changes of myocardial ischemia and electrical regeneration of the heart in subjects with       coronary artery diseases. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The Problem: Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases CVD is a major health care problem       across the entire word, and particularly in the United States, Japan and European Countries       1. In fact, these life-threatening disorders are a major cause of emergency medical care       and hospitalization in the United States, and according the National Center for Health       Statistics NCHS there were approximately 1,565,000 hospitalizations for primary or       secondary diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome ACS, 669,000 for unstable angina UA       and 896,000 for myocardial infarction MI. In the 2003, NCHS reported 4,497,000 visits to       emergency departments for primary diagnosis of CVD, wherein the average age of a person       having a first heart attack is calculated at 65.8 years for men and 70.4 years for women 2        Although the treatment of angina, chest pain secondary to coronary heart disease stable       chronic angina and one of the most common and early symptom of Coronary Heart Disease CHD       can be tracked as far as 1880s, it still represents a medically unresolved problem. Indeed,       treatment of angina in particular, as well as associated condition as ACS, UA, and MI,       involves a large number of life-style recommendations, dietetic advice, drugs, coronary       artery intervention, or coronary bypass surgery aimed to improve symptoms, quality of life       of patients, and even primary or secondary prevention of the stable chronic angina.       Unfortunately, despite a century of medical advances and epidemiological studies, the       current approach to CVD and coronary heart disease remain complex, and at times frustrating.        Among the proposals to treat stable chronic angina new aspects have been considered,       including the single polypill agent aspirin + statin + 3 blood pressure lowering agents       in half dose, and folic acid, Simvastatin and intravascular ultrasound study, or       intra-coronary angiogenesis therapy 3-5. However, most of them are unpractical, whereas it       is difficult to determine whether these changes will translate to meaningful reductions in       clinical events, or whether results in highly selected patient populations can be matched to       the real-world of prevention and treatment of coronary artery syndromes.        Further, a recent large clinical trial, COURAGE study 6, conducted in 50 hospital centers       in the United States and Canada showed that optimal drug treatment and percutaneous coronary       interventions for stable coronary heart disease, was not more effective than optimal medical       therapy alone for preventing cardiovascular events, hospitalization or death, suggesting       that drugs, surgical procedures or both were not a statistically effective solution for       stable chronic angina. By inference, a therapeutic approach for mot severe coronary       syndromes as UA, post- myocardial infarction angina, or aggravated angina episodes, seems to       be a more distant goal.        Physiological Basis for Innovation: For more than a century, the extremely rapid coupled       tissue O2/CO2 gas exchange and ion H/K transport by Hemoglobin Hb in red blood cell RBC       has been well known for scientific community, the so-called Bohr/Haldane Effect 7. Since       then, it has been noted and confirmed that RBC have a critical role to maintain normal       vascular function, blood flow and tissue oxygenation and acid-base regulation. These       functional roles of RBC include a nitric oxide NO transport, NO synthetasa, and regulation       of platelet aggregation, vascular rheology, and endothelial function 8. Indeed, recent       studies have demonstrated that erythrocyte serves as a regulator of vascular tone and tissue       perfusion, whereas the hemoglobin and RBC itself may be sensors for the oxygen tissue       requirement 9.        In this context, the evidence that erythrocytes are the major intravascular storage of       nitrites 10, and that nitroglycerin effects on erythrocyte rheology and oxygen unloading       in myocardial ischemia are mediated by S-Nitrosohemoglobin 11 implies that RBC K exchange       should be preserved in subjects with CHD, especially if a hereditable defect in RBC K       transport exists 12. Unfortunately, and despite such multiple integrated functions to       maintain tissue oxygenation in health and diseases states, the role of RBC has never been       considered in the therapeutic approach of stable chronic angina 13. However, our recent       observation that reversal of an abnormal low RBC K content in hypertensive patients       receiving low doses of pyrazinoylguanidine hydrochloride amiloride HCl, 5 mg, and calcium       gluconolactate was associated with a better control of BP, and regression of the ST-T       alterations related to LVH or coronary heart disease 14, strongly support a novel       mechanistic approaches to improve blood flow and myocardium oxygen transport in stable       chronic angina.        Informed consent will be obtained in each patient, and the Review board committee of the       Docent Institute of Urology, University of Carabobo Medical School, Valencia, will approve       the trial.

Significance/Background: Fetomaternal hemorrhage FMH is a condition in which occurs when       the placenta transfers blood from the fetus to the mother. Normally, nutrition and gasses       pass from mother to baby through the placenta and only waste products pass from baby to       mother through the placenta. Whole blood cells do not normally cross the placenta in       significant amounts. Mild FMH, where a small amount of whole blood passes from fetus to       mother but does not hurt the mother or baby, occurs in about 75% of pregnancies. A pregnant       woman does not know this occurs. It is only discovered if a special blood test that is       labor-intensive to perform and difficult to interpret called the Kleihauer-Betke acid       elution test is done. As mild FMH hurts no one, this test is not part of routine care. In       most cases, testing is done only if a baby is born sick with unexplained anemia. Severe FMH,       which can cause the baby to become sick from anemia low red blood cell count is caused by       large blood loss into the mother, occurs in only 1-3 per 1000 births. Severe anemia caused       by FMH can result in death of the baby before or after birth, or significant illness in the       newborn period. Short term problems for the baby include difficulty breathing, difficulty       maintaining blood pressure, and difficulty providing oxygen to all parts of the body. This       can cause multiple problems with the function of internal organs including the liver,       kidneys, intestines, and brain. Babies who become sick from severe FMH can develop long-term       problems including cerebral palsy a lifelong problem with body movements and/or mental       retardation.        It is not known why some pregnancies are affected by FMH and others are not. It is thought       that FMH may occur more frequently now than in the past, but no one knows why. If identified       early, FMH is readily treatable by blood transfusion of the baby before or after birth       and/or early delivery. Current laboratory testing for FMH is difficult and expensive. There       is great need identify high risk patients early in pregnancy in order to treat the condition       before the baby gets sick.        Approach: Five hundred women will be asked to participate in the study at the time they are       admitted to the Mount Sinai labor floor for delivery at term. After birth, newborns of study       mothers will be tested for anemia. Mothers of anemic babies will donate blood for       confirmation of FMH by established laboratory methods as well as for development of a new       laboratory screening protocol. All mothers will provide medical, social, environmental, and       full pregnancy history. Risk factors for FMH will be identified by statistical analysis of       this information. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       1. Introduction:             The objective of this study is to identify candidate clinical predictors of            fetomaternal hemorrhage FMH and to devise a screening strategy to identify            pregnancies affected by the condition before the fetus is compromised by severe anemia.             Fetomaternal hemorrhage is a condition in which the placental barrier fails and the            fetus bleeds into the maternal circulation. When functioning correctly, the placenta            allows transfer of nutrients and waste between the mother and fetus while keeping the            cellular components of blood separate. It is not uncommon for small amounts of fetal            blood to reach the maternal circulation without adverse effect on the fetus. In fact,            mild FMH can be detected in up to 75% of normal pregnancies. In approximately 3 in 1000            pregnancies, however, the volume of fetal blood transferred to the mother causes            clinically-significant anemia in the fetus. Fetal anemia can cause significant            morbidity and mortality. In fetuses who survive severe anemia, life-long disability is            common.             Diagnosis of FMH is most commonly made after an adverse fetal or neonatal outcome has            occurred, indicating the need for testing. Early risk factors for FMH are unknown.            Clinical predictors of FMH have been suggested, but have not been born out in            retrospective study. Current standard of care testing for FMH, the Kleihauer-Betke KB            acid elution test, is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and therefore expensive.            Additionally, the KB test is observer-dependent and can be significantly affected by            variations in sample preparation. No screening protocol for FMH with automated            laboratory testing appropriate for use in the general pregnant population exists.             Specific Aim: To identify an appropriate laboratory protocol for diagnosis of            fetomaternal hemorrhage by prospective study and to pilot a study intended to determine            early clinical predictors of mild fetomaternal hemorrhage.          2. Background and Significance Fetomaternal hemorrhage occurs when the normal flow of            blood within the placenta is disrupted and the cellular components of fetal blood cross            into the maternal circulation. A healthy placenta permits transfer of dissolved            substances between the mother and fetus while keeping the cellular components of the            two circulations separate. It is common for the placental filter to leak during            normal pregnancies, resulting in transfer of small volumes of fetal whole blood into            the maternal bloodstream. Volumes of fetal blood under 1 mL can be detected in up to            75% of pregnancies. This volume of blood loss is thought to be clinically insignificant            to the fetus. Severe FMH with a large volume of blood transfer from the fetus to the            mother is less common. Although the exact volume of blood transfer needed to classify            FMH as severe is debated, it is clear that significant acute or chronic hemorrhage            leads to adverse perinatal outcome. Estimates of the incidence of severe FMH vary,            primarily because no comprehensive epidemiologic studies of the condition exist.            Estimates based on screening for Rh alloimmunization in Rhod negative women suggest            that severe FMH occurs in 1-3 of 1000 pregnancies, , but accounts for almost 14% of            otherwise unexplained fetal deaths. Large volume FMH can result in severe fetal anemia.            Although fetal anemia can manifest in utero with recognized hydrops fetalis or            intrauterine growth restriction, more commonly there are no outward signs of            FMH-related severe anemia before stillbirth, fetal distress at delivery, or neonatal            critical illness. The immediate sequelae of severe FMH for neonates that survive            delivery include devastating illnesses such as persistence of the fetal circulation,            hypovolemic shock, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Ultimate detrimental outcomes            include high rates of mental retardation, cerebral palsy, neurologic devastation, and            death. Despite these consequences, and a suspected recent rise in incidence of severe            FMH, early predictors of severe FMH remain unknown and no cause of hemorrhage can be            identified in over 80% of cases. Maternal or pregnancy risk factors appropriate for            early screening or diagnosis of severe FMH in the general pregnant population have not            been elucidated. , If identified prior to delivery, fetal anemia from FMH can be            successfully managed by intrauterine fetal transfusion and delivery prior to the onset            of labor. , Outcomes following treatment of fetal anemia with fetal transfusion, even            repeated fetal transfusion, are encouraging. Thus, empirical predictors of FMH would            offer immediate promise for improving clinical outcomes. The social and financial cost            of both initial intensive care and long-term chronic care for children with cognitive            and motor disability resulting from FMH is substantial. There is considerable need for            early risk identification and a practical screening strategy to mitigate the human and            economic costs of severe FMH.        Validated clinical predictors of FMH include decreased fetal movement, sinusoidal fetal       heart rate tracing, and hydrops fetalis. , These markers are not useful for prevention of       adverse events stemming from FMH as each signifies established severe fetal anemia. Maternal       characteristics purported to increase the risk of FMH include hypertension, placental       abruption, substance abuse, and trauma. These were evaluated in retrospective study of       stillbirths in a 1999 study. None were significantly associated with FMH. Clinical       characteristics with suspected association with FMH were evaluated in a 2004 study of       Rhod-negative women. Only twin gestation was significantly associated with FMH. It is       unknown whether the incidence of FMH in multiple gestations is higher than those in       singleton pregnancies. No prospective or retrospective epidemiologic survey of FMH in the       general pregnant population has been published. No epidemiologic description over the       spectrum mild, moderate, severe of FMH exists. No series of placental pathology drawn from       cases of FMH has been completed.        Currently, even if at-risk pregnancies worthy of screening are identified prior to       devastating outcome, laboratory testing for FMH is not straightforward. The most commonly       used laboratory test to detect and quantify the volume of fetal blood in the maternal       circulation is the Kleihauer-Betke KB acid elution test. The reagents for the KB test are       relatively inexpensive, but the test is operator-dependent and labor-intensive making it an       unappealing candidate for use in expanded screening. The test is based on the fact that an       acid eluent will lyse fragile maternal erythrocytes while fetal hemoglobin stabilizes fetal       erythrocytes. Maternal blood is obtained and exposed to the acid eluent. Remaining intact       fetal cells are stained and counted. Estimates of maternal and fetal total blood volume are       then used to calculate the volume of FMH. The KB test is influenced by sample handling, is       technician-dependent, and can be inaccurate if patient blood volumes or blood counts are not       similar to standard estimates used. It is hypothesized that using maternal height and weight       to estimate maternal blood volume for each individual tested can improve the accuracy of KB       testing. This method is not widely practiced and has not been validated in the general       pregnant population. Such a corrected KB warrants further examination.        An additional test that has been explored to avoid some of the pitfalls of KB testing is       evaluation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein AFP levels. The concentration of       fetal-derived AFP in the maternal circulation can be used to estimate volume of FMH. As AFP       levels vary during and across pregnancies, however, AFP testing is most useful when multiple       levels obtained over the course of pregnancy are compared. The vast majority of pregnant       women in the United States undergo AFP testing in the second trimester as part of the quad       or triple screening tests for fetal aneuploidy and neural tube defects. Although       theoretically viable, no published reports document the use of this second-trimester AFP       baseline level for detecting FMH following additional AFP testing closer to term.        The most accurate measurement of FMH developed to date is achieved with flow cytometry FC       using antibodies specific to the hemoglobin of fetal cells. Cells must be made permeable       chemically to permit exposure of the FC antibody to intracellular hemoglobin prior to       analysis. Additionally, FC using monoclonal antibodies to fetal hemoglobin has only been       documented to reliably diagnose FMH >0.1% in the general clinical population. This is less       sensitive than the KB test when performed under standard clinical conditions. Finally, as       currently practiced, FC using antibodies to fetal hemoglobin is time-consuming and       expensive. This test is therefore not appropriate for large-scale screening at this time.        No series of placental pathology related to FMH has been published. As FMH is thought to be       a disease of placental failure, systematic review of placentas of pregnancies affected by       FMH could illuminate the pathogenesis of this type of placental abnormality.        Fetomaternal hemorrhage is an under-studied disease entity with significant associated       morbidity and mortality. This study aims to identify early clinical predictors of the       disease and to develop an automated screening strategy appropriate for wide-spread use.       Standard epidemiologic techniques will be used in combination with adaptation of existing       laboratory techniques to fully address this problem.        4. Methods: To address these Specific Aims, we propose 1 to test our automated laboratory       testing procedures for FMH and 2 to pilot a protocol using the novel automated laboratory       testing procedures to identify neonate-mother pairs affected by FMH for identification of       early clinical predictors of FMH. This is a pilot prospective nested case-control study.        In collaboration with the Red Cell Physiology laboratory at the New York Blood Center, we       have developed a prototype automated assay for FMH using flow cytometry facilities and       reagents available at the New York Blood Center.        A convenience sample of women admitted to the Mount Sinai Medical Center labor floor will be       selected for this pilot study. Eligible women will be those admitted for term delivery       delivery between 37 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks from the last menstrual period. Mothers carrying       fetuses with known fetal anomaly will be excluded. Women with pre-eclampsia or anomaly of       placental implantation accreta, abruption will be included, as these conditions may place       the pregnancy at risk for FMH but do not currently indicate pregnancy surveillance for fetal       anemia. Multiple gestations will be included. Women unable to complete the consent process       due to likely precipitous delivery, severe labor discomfort, or fetal distress requiring       immediate obstetric intervention will be excluded. Each woman will be enrolled in the study       prior to the required antepartum blood draw and/or IV placement, such that a study blood       specimen can be obtained with clinically indicated phlebotomy. Study specimens will be       banked for batch testing those from pregnancies of interest.        Not all women who donate blood as part of this study will have their blood tested for signs       of FMH. Although 5mL of blood will be drawn from eligible consenting women prior to       delivery, only specimens of those selected for our stratified sample population based on       neonatal hematocrit HCT will be tested. All maternal blood drawn will be fixed and/or       frozen immediately after phlebotomy for later batched analysis.        Eligible neonates of consenting mothers will have 0.5mL approximately 3 drops of blood       collected for determination of hematocrit at the time of the required blood draw for the New       York State Newborn Screening Program on day two of life. Eligibility will be determined by       the absence of a clinical history other than FMH to explain neonatal anemia. Clinical       indicators of anemia unrelated to FMH that will be treated as exclusion criteria include       hemolytic disease due to known Rh, Kell, etc sensitization, or Coombs test positive, known       significant cord compression at the time of delivery prolapsed cord, tight cord around the       neck or body, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome recognized as anemia in the donor twin and       polycythemia in the recipient twin, and known neonatal blood loss unclamped cord,       laceration. Neonates who have hematocrit measured within the first 48 hours of life for a       clinical indication will not have additional blood drawn for this study; results of       clinically-indicated samples will be used. All newborns of enrolled mothers will have HCT       tested. All mother-baby pairs with demonstrated neonatal anemia HCT ≤ 50% will be included       in the pilot cohort. In the case of multiple gestation, all siblings will be included for       analysis if any demonstrate anemia. Twenty-five percent of neonates with HCT over 50% will       also be included in the pilot cohort every fourth study subject with HCT > 50%. This       sampling strategy will allow evaluation over the spectrum of newborn blood counts,       over-representing those with anemia.        Maternal blood of study cohort subjects undergo multiple tests for FMH including FC, AFP,       and KB. Flow cytometry will be performed at the New York Blood Center. Determination of AFP       level and KB testing will be performed by the Mount Sinai Hospital laboratory.        Maternal blood samples will be appropriately fixed at the time of collection, then frozen       and batch tested weekly. Any clinically-indicated testing for FMH will be performed       independently on blood specimens obtained post-partum, and will not be included in our       analysis. All available first trimester AFP testing results will be obtained for cohort       mothers. Anthropometric data will be gathered to correct testing results for estimated       maternal blood volume based on maternal height and weight. Accuracy of various testing       methods at predicting volume of fetal blood in the maternal circulation will be determined       by comparison with the KB specimens corrected for actual rather than estimated maternal       blood volume.        All placentas of study subjects will be fixed and held by the pathology laboratory for       standard one-week duration post-partum. Thirty pregnancies chosen by stratified sampling       based on severity of FMH will have the pregnancy placentas subjected to a full pathologic       exam. Standard examination techniques including gross and microscopic exam will be used.        After study cohort mothers have been identified, we will collect medical, social,       environmental, and full pregnancy history via directed interview. Elements of particular       interest will include those hypothesized in the literature to be associated with FMH.       Factors suspected in the literature as being associated with FMH include maternal       hypertension during pregnancy, maternal pre-eclampsia, maternal trauma during pregnancy,       placental abruption, and multiple gestation. The survey tool will investigate these elements       of the maternal history as well as take a broad survey of the environmental and social       history in an attempt to identify unrecognized clinical predictors of FMH. Maternal subjects       will be interviewed during the post-partum stay in the hospital. Data will be used for       identification of early risk factors of FMH.        Risk factors will be identified through logistic regression modeling with a multilevel       outcome in which FMH is coded as absent referent, mild, or severe, generating separate       odds ratios for mild and severe FMH. The alternate laboratory approaches to identification       of FMH will be compared by examining agreement using a kappa statistic, and quantifying       agreement across categories.

Although the pathogenesis of AITD       remains unclear, it is generally thought that the mechanisms of the disease is a complex       disease in which susceptibility genes and environmental triggers act in concert to initiate       the autoimmune response to the thyroid.        The initial step of thyroid autoimmunity is the activation of T cells. The activation of T       cell requires two signals: firstly, thyroid follicular cells or antigen presenting cells       binds to T cell receptor through antigenic HLA complex. Secondly, the activation of T cells       is also required the interaction of costimulatory molecules between thyroid follicular cells       and immune cells, including CTLA-4, CD 40, CD28, ICOS. PPAR- is a kind of intranuclear       transcription factor, associated with adipogenesis and inflammation.

The activation of T       cell requires two signals: firstly, thyroid follicular cells or antigen presenting cells       binds to T cell receptor through antigenic HLA complex. Secondly, the activation of T cells       is also required the interaction of costimulatory molecules between thyroid follicular cells       and immune cells, including CTLA-4, CD 40, CD28, ICOS. PPAR- is a kind of intranuclear       transcription factor, associated with adipogenesis and inflammation. Some reports showed       that PPAR- polymorphism may have a protective effect from Graves ophthalmopathy.        The goal of the study is to investigate the relationship among SNP and mRNA of costimulatory       molecules and PPAR- , serum cytokine including TNF- and sIL-2R, and clinical characteristics       in AITD patients. From the study, we hope to clarify the role of costimulatory molecules and       PPAR- polymorphism in AITD.

Oxytocin is the       most commonly uterotonic drug used to prevent and treat PPH in North America, however, there       are some limitations to its use. Oxytocin has a very short duration of action, which       requires a continuous infusion to achieve sustained uterotonic activity. The Society of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada SOGC has recently recommended a single 100mcg       dose of carbetocin at elective Cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction and prevent       post partum hemorrhage PPH, in lieu of the more traditional oxytocin regimens. Carbetocin       lasts 4 to 7 times longer than oxytocin, with a similar side effect profile and apparent       greater efficacy rate. However, a dose response to determine the minimum effective dose of       carbetocin has not yet been published.        We hypothesize that a dose-response study will establish the minimum dose of carbetocin       required to produce appropriate contractility in 95% of the women ED95 undergoing elective       cesarean delivery. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada SOGCrecently recommended a 100mcg       intravenous bolus dose of carbetocin following Cesarean delivery. However, a dose response       study to determine the minimum effective dose of carbetocin has not yet been published.        Studies thus far show that carbetocin may be just as effective as oxytocin in promoting       uterine contraction, with a similar side effects profile. In addition, patients receiving       carbetocin may experience less blood loss, and require less additional uterotonics when       compared with oxytocin.        The results of this study will define the minimum required dose of carbetocin for uterine       contraction, thus minimizing unnecessary side effects, improving quality and safety of       patient care. It may also contribute in establishing carbetocin as a substitute to oxytocin       for elective cesarean section at our institution as well as others.

Patients who have central       hypothyroidism usually have concomitant deficiencies in other pituitary hormones for which       they need replacement therapy such as steroids, testosterone and growth hormone. This       combined hormone deficiency makes clinical and laboratory evaluation challenging among these       patients.

It has been suggested that levodopa, a medication that is usually used to treat Parkinson       disease in adults, may help children with AS in their overall development and reduce the       tremor that some of them have.        If levodopa is found to be beneficial for children with AS, this could lead to a new       treatment for AS.        Funding Source - FDA-OOPD DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Levodopa is a prodrug that delivers dopamine to the brain. It is usually given with       carbidopa, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, to increase the bioavailability of       levodopa. Animal studies have suggested that levodopa can reverse the excess phosphorylation       of some enzymes involved in synaptic and neuronal function, including       calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type 2 CaMKII.        Recently, it was shown that excess phosphorylation of CaMKII may be responsible for some of       the neurological deficits seen in Angelman syndrome. Therefore, it is hypothesized that       levodopa may lead to an improvement in the neurodevelopment and abnormal movements e.g.       tremors in children with Angelman syndrome.        Although many children have used levodopa for a variety of medical conditions over the last       30 years, it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration FDA for use in       children, and it has not been formally studied in children with Angelman syndrome.

For hemodynamic stabilization the SSC recommends distinct treatment       goals. The study hypothesis is that a tissue perfusion guided protocol could reduce the       duration on vasopressor treatment compared to a conventional protocol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background        Septic shock is a frequent and severe entity with a mortality of 55%. The Surviving Sepsis       Campaign SSC published 2008 revised guidelines to improve survival of septic shock       patients.        For hemodynamic stabilization the SSC recommends as treatment goals a mean arterial blood       pressure > 65mmHg MAP, a central venous blood pressure of 8-12 mmHg, a mixed venous oxygen       saturation >65%, a central venous oxygen saturation > 70% and a diuresis > 0.5 ml/kg/h 1.       According to the SSC guidelines a MAP > 65 mmHg should be aimed because at this blood       pressure level tissue perfusion is preserved. This is based on a study in ten septic shock       patients where norepinephrine was titrated to three levels 65, 75 and 85 mmHg and the       authors concluded that parameters of tissue perfusion did not differ between the each level       2.        Objective        To evaluate if a hemodynamic protocol guided by parameters of tissue perfusion could reduce       the duration of vasopressor treatment in septic shock patients.        Methods        Patients suffering from septic shock requiring vasopressor support are randomly assigned to       a control group usual care and an intervention group tissue perfusion guided protocol.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01297387","TITLE:       Feasibility of Peripheral Angioplasty in Type D TASCII Lesions SUMMARY:       This observational prospective study will evaluate, according o usual local clinical       practice, feasibility of endoluminal revascularization in diabetic patients with type C and       D lesions, according to TASC II Criteria.        About 300 patients will be treated with usual revascularization procedure. Each patient will       be followed at least 12 months to evaluate clinical outcome and limb salvage interventions. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       In 2000, the Trans Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus TASC stated that patients with CLI       should be treated with revascularization, to provide sufficient blood flow to relieve the       rest pain and heal skin lesions. TASC also suggested that the best procedure should avoid a       general anaesthesia, pose a lesser systemic stress and have fewer serious complications.        All these considerations pose peripheral angioplasty PTA as the procedure of choice, when       feasible.        Unfortunately, TASC Recommendations, published in 2000 and confirmed in 2007, use       morphological criteria to define guidelines for the choice of revascularization procedure.        According to these recommendations, type C and D lesions, which comprise most serious       stenosis and occlusions, affecting long tracts of vessels, are candidate to bypass       interventions, more than PTA.        This choice was due to the first impression, then denied by BASIL study, that PTA could be       affected by a reduced efficacy on limb salvage.        Diabetic Patients are characterized by high prevalence of long occlusions in crural arteries       and this anatomical asset reduces, according to TASC II criteria, the feasibility of Bypass       Graft BPG in a large number of such patients.        Our preliminary experience showed the feasibility of PTA in diabetic patients with Chronic       Critical Limb Ischemia CLI, with a high percentage of efficient revascularization,       regardless of morphology and number of obstructions.        This study aims to evaluate outcomes after PTA procedure also in patients with lesions of 20       cm or longer in superficial femoral arteries or with long lesions in subpopliteal       arteries.        All diabetic patients referring to our Diabetic Foot Centre either for foot lesions or rest       pain will be assessed for the presence of Critical Limb Ischemia CLI according to TASC II       Criteria.        These patients, according to usual local clinical practice, will undergo to angiographic       evaluation and, if feasible, to peripheral angioplasty.        The peripheral pulses will be evaluated by palpation and auscultation with a continuous-wave       Doppler technique, the ankle-pressure will be recorded, when assessable foot arteries       absent or not compressible because of medial calcifications, the transcutaneous oxygen       tension TcPO2 will be evaluated at the dorsum of the foot and a duplex scanning will be       performed. In all patients with one reduced or absent foot pulse, TcPO2 < 50 mmHg,       ankle-pressure < 70 mmHg, significant obstructions present at duplex scanning, an       arteriography will be carried out. In all patient with obstruction > 50% of vessel diameter,       PTA will be the first-choice revascularization procedure and will be performed in the same       session of the angiographic study. In patients in whom PTA will not be feasible, a by-pass       operation was considered. The patients in whom PTA or BPG were not possible, received a       therapy with prostanoids or lumbar sympathectomy plus prostanoids, when possible. In       patients in whom the therapies did not relieve the rest pain or the gangrene was extended       above the Chopart joint, an above-the-ankle-amputation was proposed and performed.        PTA procedure PTA was considered indicated for angiographically documented obstructions       greater than 50% of the vessel lumen. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia       through antegrade puncture of the ipsilateral common femoral artery. If obstructions were       present in the iliac trunk at duplex scanning, the puncture was performed by contralateral       approach. Vessel recanalization was considered successful when direct flow was obtained in       treated vessel, with no residual stenosis > 50% of vessel diameter along the artery.        BPG procedure The choice of proximal and distal BPG anastomoses depended on the angiographic       picture and aimed at obtaining at least one patent foot artery. The inflow was optimized,       when possible, by combining femoral-popliteal bypass and PTA of the iliac trunk. Moreover,       also in view of a following distal angioplasty, the distal anastomosis was performed on the       most suitable popliteal or tibial artery segment by using intraluminal clamping and       microsurgical technique. The surgery has always been carried out under epidural anesthesia.       The autogenous saphena vein was employed if present and in good condition. If venous conduit       could not be used, alloplastic prosthetic material polytetrafluoroethylene: PTFE was       employed and the peripheral below-the-knee anastomosis consisted of a venous cuff using the       Millers technique, or composite bypass with interposition of distal venous segments. The       absence of an available saphena and an angiographic score of run off >7 on the Rutherford       scale did not exclude any patient, who otherwise could be eligible only for a major       amputation, from a revascularization with distal bypass.        Treatment of non revascularized patients Prostanoids alprostadil-α-cyclodextrine 60-120       μgr/day were infused intravenously on average 5 days before hospital discharge. When       possible and accepted by the patients, lumbar sympathectomy was performed.        In all patients the pain change was recorded and the TcPO2 and ankle-pressure values were       reassessed 5 days after the PTA, BPG, lumbar sympathectomy and medical therapy.        Limb salvage In patients complaining of rest pain without foot ulcer, the disappearance of       pain was considered to be a successful limb salvage. In patients with foot ulcer we       considered limb salvage successful when the ulcer was healed and plantar stand was       maintained, even when achieved by tarsal-metatarsal amputation and the patient is able to       walk without crutches or artificial leg. Conversely, any above-the-ankle amputation was       considered a failure. Limb salvage was considered early when pain disappeared and ulcer       healed in 30 days after hospital admission.        Follow-up After hospital discharge All the patients with foot ulcer were examined weekly       until ulcer healing. All patients were provided with extra-deep rocker shoes with soft       thermoformable leather and customized insoles.        Evidence of PTA restenosis was assessed clinically only, based on pain reappearance or ulcer       recurrence. In these situations ankle-pressure and TcPO2 were reassessed and duplex scanning       was performed 22. If ankle pressure and TcPO2 were significantly worse <15% of the       post-PTA value and Duplex scanning was positive, the patient underwent a repeated       angiographic evaluation and a further PTA, if possible. Morphological restenosis was not       investigated: in absence of rest pain or ulcer reappearance we do not perform any       revascularization 23, therefore we consider the morphological restenosis clinically       irrelevant.        BPG treated patients were followed with vascular surgery protocol 24. The graft patency       was assessed with clinical examination and ultrasound study at 30 days, 3,6,12 months and       thereafter every 6 months. Pulse systolic velocity and anastomosis morphology were assessed       by ultrasound study. Finally, inflow is compared with pre-operative condition.        For every invasive treatment PTA, BPG, sympathectomy, surgical operation on the foot the       written informed consent form was proposed and obtained from the patient.

Vaccines made from peptides or       antigens may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.       Recombinant interleukin-12 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by       stimulating white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as       daclizumab, may decrease the number of regulatory T cells T cells that suppress the       activation of the immmune system and may lead to a better immune response against melanoma.       It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy is more effective with interleukin-12 and       daclizumab in treating melanoma. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:        I. To determine if admixture of IL-12 recombinant interleukin-12 with vaccine emulsion       will increase the frequency of vaccine-induced cluster of differentiation CD8+ T cells in       the blood.        II. To determine if administration of daclizumab will deplete CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells       from the peripheral and potentiate specific immune responses induced by vaccination.        III. To determine if vaccination +/- daclizumab will be safe in this patient population.        SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:        I. To determine if vaccination +/- daclizumab will have clinical activity in patients with       advanced melanoma.        II. To determine if clinical response may be associated with particular gene expression       profiles in the tumor microenvironment.        OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.        ARM I: Patients receive multipeptide vaccination comprising recombinant MAGE-3.1 antigen,       MART-1 antigen, gp100 antigen, and NA17-A2 peptide emulsified with Montanide ISA-51       intradermically ID or subcutaneously SC on days 1, 22, and 50.        ARM II: Patients receive vaccination as in arm I with an admixture of recombinant       interleukin-12 IL-12 on days 1, 22, and 50.        In both arms, patients are evaluated for immune response. Patients with partial response or       stable disease may be immunized for up to a maximum of 1 year. Patients with complete       response may be treated with 1 additional course of 3 vaccinations.        EXPANDED COHORT: Additional patients are accrued to the arm with higher immune response and       receive daclizumab IV over 15 minutes on day -7. Patients then receive vaccination as in arm       I or arm II on days 1, 22, and 50 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable       toxicity.

VTE remains the most common cause of maternal death in the developed world. It is up       to 10 times more common in pregnant women than non-pregnant women of comparable age. More       than a third of pregnancy-related VTE occurs during the six weeks after delivery. When       compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery further increases the risk of pregnancy       associated VTE by three-fold. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This is a double blind- a randomized controlled study of prophylactic LMWH in women at low       risk for VTE following a cesarean section procedure. The sample size is 300 patients,       Eligible, consenting, and randomized participants will receive once-daily injections of       study drug 4,500 IU Tinzaparin Sodium [Innohep®] within 12- to 24-hours postpartum and       continue for two weeks versus Placebo in the other arm and follow for six 6 weeks       postpartum.        On the day of hospital discharge, bilateral leg imaging with compression, leg ultrasounds,       and pelvic vein imaging with MRV will be completed. The primary outcome will be adjudicated,       while DVT will be documented on ultrasounds or MRV on the day of hospital discharge.       Secondary outcomes will include symptomatic DVT and PE, death from PE, major and minor       bleeding, and HIT during the six-week postpartum period.

To better understand the reasons for mobility difficulties in older       persons, researchers conducted a population-based study of individuals living in the Chianti       geographic area of Tuscany, Italy. Researchers are now interested in conducting a follow-up       study on the original participants to assess the effects of aging on their mobility.        Objectives:        - To conduct a follow-up study on the participants in the mobility study of older persons in       the Greve in Chianti and Bagno a Ripoli areas near Florence, Italy.        Eligibility:        - Original participants in the InChianti Mobility Study.        Design:          -  The InChianti Follow-up Study will repeat most elements of the baseline evaluation from            the original study. Participants will be seen on the 3-year anniversary of their            baseline study assessment.          -  Participants will have a home interview with questions about their physical and mental            health, family history, daily activities, and living conditions related to their            continued mobility.          -  Participants will provide blood and urine samples, and will have tests of heart and            motor nerve function and imaging studies of bones and the circulatory system.          -  Participants will also have a functional evaluation of their motor skills, including            walking tests, range of motion tests, and grip strength. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       In the past decade epidemiologic and clinical studies have described the prevalence and       incidence of disability and have elucidated demographic characteristics, health behaviors,       diseases, and physiologic impairments that are associated with increased risk of developing       disability in old age. Mobility disability has emerged as a critical aspect of functioning.       Mobility, defined as the ability to move independently from one point to another, is a       critical part of maintaining independence and an essential attribute of quality of life. In       those age 85 years and older, nearly 60 percent of women and 40 percent of men have       difficulty walking two to three blocks. Older people who are mobile are more likely to       remain in the community, have lower rates of subsequent morbidity and mortality, and have       higher quality of life. Recent work in biomechanics, clinical geriatrics, epidemiology, and       clinical trials has helped to improve our understanding of the decline in walking ability in       old age and the influence of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, a great deal       is still not understood about how older persons progressively lose the ability to ambulate.       The InChianti Study has the potential to make major new advances in our knowledge of       progressive decline in ambulation in older persons.        A great deal of information is available from the baseline evaluation in this study and the       crosssectional analyses that can be done with these data will be very valuable. There are,       however, limitations in what we can learn from cross-sectional data. The baseline data       revealed many relationships between factors that were studied and disability, but there may       be circularity in these relationships that cannot be sorted out if we only have       cross-sectional data available. For example, abnormalities in certain biomarkers may be a       cause of disability or may be caused by disability. Only by doing longitudinal analyses that       begin with non-disabled persons can the temporal sequence be determined. Cross-sectional       analyses only permit the study of factors that are currently related to disability while       longitudinal analyses allow for the identification of subclinical markers of risk that       predict future disability onset. There is therefore much to be gained by performing a       follow-up evaluation of the cohort to obtain longitudinal data.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01388400","TITLE:       Enriched Environments for Upper Limb Stroke Rehabilitation SUMMARY:       Stroke contributes significantly to the incidence of disabilities, with upper limb UL       motor impairment being especially prevalent. Animal studies suggest that post-stroke motor       recovery is largely attributable to adaptive plasticity in brain motor areas. While some       environmental training factors contributing to plastic mechanisms have been identified in       animals, translation of this knowledge to the clinical setting is insufficient. Optimal       recovery may be related to both external e.g., feedback type and internal factors e.g.,       cognitive ability, motivation. Clinically feasible methods for training are needed. Use of       enriched virtual environments VEs may provide a way to address these needs. Outcome       measures that best reflect recovery need to be identified since this is an essential step to       evaluate the effect of novel training programs for UL motor recovery in stroke.        The research question is which clinical and kinematic outcome measures best reflect motor       performance recovery after a targeted upper limb treatment intervention. Aim 1 is to compare       changes in outcome measures recorded before and after an upper limb intervention in stroke       subjects to motor performance in healthy subjects. Aim 2 is to determine motor performance       between-group differences sample size is based on knowledge of expected outcome measure mean       score differences between groups. Hypothesis. 1: Specific clinical and kinematic outcome       measures will be sensitive to within-group pre-post intervention training changes.       Hypothesis. 2: Specific clinical and kinematic outcome measures will be sensitive to       between-group healthy vs. patients in enriched vs. conventional intervention groups.       Sixteen chronic stroke survivors and 8 age- and sex-matched healthy controls will       participate. Patients will be matched on cognitive and motor impairment levels and divided       into two groups. Using an single subject A-B-A research design, kinematics during two       pre-tests, 3 weeks apart, will be recorded for test-retest reliability. Stroke groups will       practice varied upper limb reaching movements 15 45-minute sessions in 3 weeks in       environments providing different motivation/feedback levels. Pre- and post motor performance       evaluations will be done with clinical tests and a Test Task with specific motor performance       requirements. A Transfer Task will also be recorded. By comparing data analysis methods       3-Dimensional 3D analysis of different markers or placements, the investigators will       identify which kinematic outcome measures best reflect motor improvement in post-test and       follow-up sessions retention.        The expected results are identification of two primary and two secondary outcome measures       that reflect upper limb motor recovery and can distinguish between motor recovery and       compensation. The results will be used to design a randomized control trial to determine the       efficacy of VE-based treatment on arm motor recovery. The goal is to determine how extrinsic       environmental and intrinsic personal motivational factors affect motor learning in       stroke survivors with cognitive and physical impairment. Knowledge gained can also be used       for rehabilitation of other neurological and orthopedic pathologies. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       A. Scientific Background        Stroke is the third leading cause of death in Western countries and upper limb UL       sensorimotor dysfunction contributes significantly to the incidence of physical disabilities       and handicaps Olsen 1990. One explanation for poor arm recovery is the focus on task       accomplishment rather than performance quality. This may reinforce alterative compensatory       movement strategies instead of encouraging the reappearance of pre-morbid movement patterns       recovery. Although the rehabilitative goal is recovery of function, whether this is       achieved through true motor recovery or compensation is still under debate. Indeed, for some       patients with severe impairment, compensation should be encouraged to maximize functional       ability. Alternatively, for those with good prognosis, motor recovery is emphasized for       several reasons. First, given appropriate training, recovery can continue well into the       chronic stage of stroke e.g., Michaelsen & Levin 2004. Second, while compensation may       assist immediate performance, it may lead to longer-term problems such as pain and       contracture Ada et al. 1994; Levin 1997. Third, permitting compensations could encourage       learned nonuse limiting the capacity for subsequent motor gains Allred et al. 2005. While       performance gains have been documented after repetitive training of isolated movements       e.g., Whitall et al. 2000, few studies have addressed whether patients can use explicit       information to optimize motor skill acquisition and whether true behavioural recovery       occurs. Points to consider in developing optimal training programs is that learning occurs       when participants are motivated, practice a variety of related tasks and are given relevant       feedback Nudo & Friel 1999; Winstein et al. 1999. In addition, patients may not benefit       from variable practice until missing motor elements are recovered Carr & Shepherd 1987 and       motor relearning is related to physical and cognitive impairment level Cirstea et al.       2006.        To date, most studies have used only clinical measures to evaluate functional change e.g.,       Jang et al. 2003 without considering how movement is performed. This study will focus on       the ability to distinguish between whether functional improvement results from an increase       in compensation or from true motor recovery. This can only be done by correlating functional       improvement clinical measures with changes in arm motor patterns through detailed movement       analysis kinematics. Since there are a large number of possible kinematic indicators of       improvement, the investigators need to identify which measures are most indicative of       change. This is a first step in the determination of clinically meaningful outcome measures       to be used in randomized control trials of the effectiveness of interventions. Clinical       salience is essential to translate knowledge from research studies to evidence-based       practice van Peppen et al. 2007.        B. Study Design: 1. Detailed Plan of the Study        Two groups of 8 stroke subjects will participate in an A-B-A design in which data from       post-intervention within one week of the completion of the intervention and follow-up one       month after the completion of the interventiontests will be compared to data from two       pre-tests held at beginning and end of the first week of the study just prior to the start       of the intervention. Multiple clinical and kinematic motor performance outcomes will be       measured to determine which ones best describe arm motor recovery. This will be done by       comparing changes in outcomes before and after training to mean scores of 8 age- and       gender-matched healthy volunteers recorded in a single session. Stroke survivors will       practice movement in two different training environments providing different levels of       motivation and feedback: Training Environment 1 will be created in a 2D video-based VR       environment that will provide high motivation, Knowledge of Results KR about motor outcome       i.e., speed, precision and non-specific Knowledge of Performance KP feedback about trunk       movement. Environment 2 will be created in a physical environment that provides only KP       feedback but no KR or additional motivation.        Training Protocol: After baseline evaluations physical & cognitive, stroke groups will       practice pointing to 6 standardized targets placed just beyond reach 12 trials per target       during an acquisition phase of 15 sessions spaced over three weeks 3 sessions/wk, 72       trials/session. This practice regimen incorporates elements necessary for optimal motor       learning: 1 Varied practice: Although the movements are not new motor tasks, they should be       re-acquired during stroke recovery. Our aim is not teach subjects a novel task but to       identify how a movement performed sub-optimally may be improved with practice. 2 Intensive       practice: The number of repetitions per session was chosen according to studies by Cirstea       and Levin 2000. Thus, 72 trials per session 3 blocks of 24 trials, 5 min rest between       blocks are considered as intensive practice, which is a necessary element for a       successful training program. Following the acquisition phase, evaluations which will be       repeated after 3mos to evaluate retention and transfer of motor skills.        2. Methods: Subjects Eight stroke subjects per group will be recruited. They will be matched       for age and for initial arm motor severity ± 5 pts on the Fugl-Meyer Arm Assessment. Eight       age- and sex-matched healthy subjects will be recruited as a control group.        Subject Recruitment: Patients will be recruited from Haim Sheba Hospital discharge lists       using a procedure in place since 2005. Screening will be done by clinical research       associates. Potential participants meeting inclusion criteria 1-3 and exclusion criteria       will be sent an explanatory letter inviting them to contact study investigators. Informed       consent will be obtained from each participant. Control subjects will be recruited from the       community.        Training Environments: Motivation and Feedback: Training will be done in the Dept. of       Occupational Therapy located at the Sheba Medical Center. Training environments will allow       us to evaluate the effect of combining different degrees of motivation and feedback on motor       outcome. Environment 1 is highly motivating novel and fun since training is presented as a       game in which the learner tries to beat his own score in subsequent sessions. Targets are       presented as balls in a video-based VR system Gesture Xtreme. The patient sits in front of       a 36 inch display of the 6 target scene. The patients image is captured by a video camera       and inserted into the scene displayed on the monitor. The task is to point to each of the       targets which appear in a random sequence. Feedback will provide pertinent information for       motor learning KR, KP, game score. Environment 2 incorporates the same number and       disposition of targets as Env. 1 but they will be presented in a physical environment on a       wooden frame in front of the subject. KR and KP feedback will be provided as verbal cues by       the experimenter as is done usually in the clinic. However, they will be no additional       motivational information game score.        Preliminary Outcome Measures: Clinical Before and after training in both stroke groups,       blinded evaluators will measure clinical scores of arm motor impairment and function       Fugl-Meyer Arm Score, Reaching Performance Scale, Box and Blocks test, Wolf Motor Function       Test, Motor Activity Log as well as cognitive function. All tests are valid and reliable       and are regularly used in clinical practice.        Kinematic testing: Test Task and Transfer Task:        The investigators will also record kinematic outcome measures characterizing arm and trunk       movements during reaching elbow extension, shoulder horizontal adduction, shoulder flexion,       scapular movements, trunk displacement.        Our aim is to focus on segmental and joint kinematics during a Test and a Transfer Task       consisting of reaching movements. Test Task will be recorded. The Test target will be placed       in line with the patients sternum at a distance just beyond the subjects arm length. The       Test Task is similar to movements made to one of the practiced targets. To assess motor       learning, the investigators will determine if elements learned in one task transfer to other       similar tasks. Thus, the investigators will also assess movements made in a Transfer Task,       to a target placed in front of the ipsilateral shoulder 5 centimeters cm higher than the       topmost row of trained targets. The Transfer Task is therefore a new movement, not practiced       during the training. Rigid body segmental kinematics will be recorded from sets of 4 passive       reflective markers 0.5 cm diameter spheres attached to the trunk, upper arm and forearm       segments. This will enable the computation of three translational and three rotational       degrees of freedom per segment. Joint kinematics will be collected from markers fixed on the       sternum, acromion, elbow and wrist via exo-skeletal frames. Marker motion will be recorded       with a calibrated 3 camera opto-electronic motion-capture system ProReflex MCU-240,       Qualisys on suitable computer software Qualisys, Göteborg, Swe. Data collection 100       Hertz, 2-5 seconds will be triggered by movement of the hand from a central position by       release of a mechanical switch. The accuracy of the measurements of each marker is within an       error of <0.2 cm.        As a first step, the investigators will determine movement times, accuracy, smoothness,       segment and joint rotations and the main components of multi-joint coordination. Cartesian       coordinates x,y,z for each segment will be obtained from the segmental marker sets. Raw       data from at least three markers per segment will be used after interpolation of missing       markers 5th-order polynomial. For each trial, movement times and peak velocities will be       determined from endpoint tangential velocity traces. Movement time is the time between the       point at which the tangential velocity exceeds and remains above 5% of its maximum and then       returns to and remains below this level. Movement accuracy in terms of constant extent       errors will be computed as the mean distance d between the final endpoint position x, y,       z and the position of the target x0, y0, z0. Constant and variable SD directional       errors will also be defined. Movement smoothness will be computed from the tangential       velocity trace using the index of curvature ratio of endpoint path length to length of a       straight line joining the initial and final positions and the number of peaks in the       trajectory path. For segment and joint rotations, vectors will be calculated within       reference coordinate systems for the upper and forearm segments.        From the resulting segment centroid motion and segment rotation data different outcome       variables will be calculated. The most relevant ones will define changes in performance with       respect to the endpoint motion and with respect to the whole-arm posture, particularly, the       evolution of the movement over time time derivatives and the fragmentation of the       segmental path and posture of the arm while moving towards the different targets. Additional       aspects of movement will be explored in order to find the most appropriate descriptors of       arm motor performance and changes after the proposed clinical interventions.        Change scores will be calculated for each subject to determine an Index of Improvement IP       and an Index of Learning IL. The IP is defined as the change in each variable as a ratio       of post- to pre-test values. An IP of 1 indicates no change whereas negative and positive       values indicate that the value decreased or increased respectively. For some variables,       positive ratios will indicate improvement endpoint velocity, endpoint smoothness, angle       measures, phase amplitudes while for others, improvement will be demonstrated by negative       ratios movement time, movement precision. The IL, used to determine if subjects retain       improvements after training for each follow-up epoch, is defined as the change in the       variable at retention- compared to post-test. IL values of 1 indicate that the improvement       is maintained no change, of negative value that the parameter decreased and of positive       value that the parameter increased.        Statistical analysis: For our first aim, changes in outcome measures will be determined by       comparing movement outcomes before and after the acquisition and retention phases by       two-repeated measures mixed design ANOVA MANOVA and comparing raw means Time 1, Time 2,       Time 3, Time 4 and change scores IP, IL between groups. The investigators will determine       which kinematic measures undergo the most change and thus may be most indicative of motor       recovery e.g., increase in elbow and/or shoulder movement, decrease in trunk movement by       investigating which measures are the most different between training groups. The       investigators expect changes in the group training in Environment I to be greater than those       in from the group training in Environment 2.

Trial end       points are summarized in Table I. The hypothesis is that BES is equivalent to EES or BES is       equivalent to ZES-R at the primary end point. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Previous randomized trials have shown the superior efficacy of drug-eluting stents DES,       such as sirolimus-eluting stent SES, CYPHER, Cordis, US, paclitaxel-eluting stent PES,       TAXUS, Boston Scientific, US, and zotarolimus-eluting stent ZES, Endeavor, Medtronic, US       compared with bare metal stents BMS by reducing neointimal hyperplasia, late luminal loss,       and angiographic restenosis leading to decreased target lesion revascularization.       Unfortunately, restenosis still occurs and late stent thrombosis can develop by delaying       endoluminal healing or by chronic inflammation.Accordingly, development of new DES is       required to improve efficacy by reducing revascularization and safety by reducing the risk       of stent thrombosis. With the improvement of polymer, drug, and the platform, the 2nd       generation DES, including everolimus-eluting stent EES, Xience V or Xience Prime, Abbott,       USA, zotarolimus-eluting stent with biolinx polymer ZES-R, Endeavor Resolute or Endeavor       Resolute Integrity, Medtronic, USA, and biolimus-eluting stent BES, BioMatrix or Biomatrix       Flex, Biosensors, USA, have been shown to be superior or non-inferior in safety and       efficacy trials compared with 1st generation DES.        However, it is difficult to know if there are any differences in efficacy and safety between       the EES, the ZES-R, and the BES, in real world practice due to the lack of data comparing       these three 2nd generation DES directly. This study provides the evidence for the CHOICE of       stent when physicians are treating patients by percutaneous coronary intervention.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01397643","TITLE:       A Trial of Non-operative Versus Operative Management of Olecranon Fractures in the Elderly SUMMARY:       Proximal forearm fractures comprise approximately 5% of all fractures, with olecranon       fractures accounting for almost 20% of thes fractures. There is limited conclusive evidence       regarding the optimal treatment and outcome of these fractures within the elderly population       with one case series in the literature describing 13 patients. Our trial includes all       patients equal to or over the age of 75yrs presenting to the Edinburgh and Fife Orthopaedic       Trauma Units with an isolated olecranon fracture. Patients who consent to enrol in the trial       will be randomised to operative fixation using one of two treatment methods. Patients in the       nonoperative group will be place in a sling for two weeks and then allowed to mobilise under       supervised physiotherapy as per normal protocol. For those patients in the operative group,       tension band wire of plate fixation will be employed depending on the choice of their       supervising consultant. Patients will be evaluated over a one year period following their       treatment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Patients with undisplaced olecranon fractures can be treated non-operatively. The aims of       treatment in displaced olecranon fractures are the restoration of function and stability to       the elbow joint4. The technique employed should allow preservation and reconstruction of the       articular surface with minimal associated complications. Tension-band wiring TBW is the       most recognised and commonly used fixation method, although plate fixation and       intramedullary screw fixation are noted alternatives. Potential problems with the TBW       technique are wound breakdown, infection, prominent metalwork, malunion and non-union.       Furthermore, plate fixation is considered to be superior in distal/comminuted/oblique       fractures and fracture-dislocations, with superior fracture reduction and fixation results,       as well as a lower rate of re-operation.        The above described fixation techniques can be employed in elderly people, although       difficulties associated with fixation in osteoporotic bone, wound breakdown and other       complications is reported. In these patients, fracture excision with advancement of the       triceps is a viable option if fixation is deemed inappropriate. However, there is limited       evidence to suggest that non-operative treatment of displaced olecranon fractures in these       elderly patients may provide adequate functional results. In a case series of 13 patients       mean age 81.8 years, >5 mm fracture displacement treated non-operatively for a displaced       olecranon fracture, outcome scores were excellent in 11 patients and poor in one.        Research Aim To determine if any difference exists in outcome primary measure - DASH score       after one year between non-operative management AND operative treatment for olecranon       fractures in patients 75yrs or older ≥75yrs.        Methodology This trial involves identifying patients over the age of 75yrs ≥75yrs       presenting to the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Trauma Unit and Fife Orthopaedic Trauma Unit with an       isolated olecranon fracture. Patients who consent to enrol in the trial will be randomised       to one of two recognised treatment techniques - non-operative management in a collar and       cuff for two weeks OR operative management using tension band wire fixation or plate       fixation. The trial will commence once ethical approval is granted by the Lothian Research       Ethics Committee.        All statistical analysis was/will be performed by Dr Rob Elton. Prior to the study a power       analysis determined the number of patients required in each trial. The primary outcome       measure will be the DASH score, a continuous variable that follows a normal       Gaussian-shaped distribution. This study is designed to determine a clinically relevant       mean difference of 10 points between the two cohorts at one year after enrolment. A power       analysis indicated that a total sample size of 50 25 in each group subjects will provide       80% statistical power to detect significant differences 0.05 in DASH scores, assuming an       effect size of 0.8 mean difference of 10 points, standard deviation of 12 points using an       unpaired t-test. To account for a possible loss to follow-up of up to 25%, we anticipate       enrolling 35 subjects in each cohort for a total sample size of 70 subjects. A p value of <       0.05 was considered statistically significant.        All patients presenting to the units with a fracture of the olecranon that satisfy the       inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in our study. Vulnerable populations will       not be recruited.        A qualified member of the on-call team will introduce the study to the patient and initiate       informed consent. If the patient agrees, a research fellow Trauma and Orthopaedic StR3       level, not involved with the patients care will review the study protocol in detail and       address any questions the patient may have. If the patient is willing to participate, the       research fellow will complete the informed consent with the patient. Patients will be given       a copy of the consent form, and be informed that their participation is voluntary and that       they can withdraw at any time during the study without detriment to their normal care in any       way. Patients may take as long as they like to consider participation, provided that they       still meet all the eligibility criteria documented above. Patients that are willing to       participate in this study will get the same care of their fracture as patients that decide       not to participate in the study.        On enrolment, a data collection form will be started with demographic and injury-related       information collected. Patients will be randomised performed by Dr Rob Elton using closed       opaque envelopes into one of the two groups non-operative or operative. Patients in the       non-operative group will be placed in a collar and cuff for two weeks and allowed to       mobilise under supervised physiotherapy as per normal protocol. Patients in this group can       be placed in cast ~60 degrees of flexion if pain is too severe. For those patients in the       operative group, tension band wire of plate fixation will be employed depending on the       choice of their supervising consultant. Following surgery, the post-operative assessment and       course will be as per normal protocol for patients who are not in this study. Patients in       the operative group will be immobilised depending on fracture fixation during surgery and       the decision will be made by the treating surgeon. Physiotherapy will be arranged when       required        All follow-up assessment will take place during follow-up visits initially with the treating       consultant surgeons team and a dedicated member of the research team. Radiographs and other       diagnostic studies will be obtained at the discretion of the treating surgeon and will not       differ from routine clinical care.        Follow-up assessment will be collected over a one year period 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6       months and one year. Routine follow-up in our institution for patients who have sustained       an olecranon fracture that is managed operatively involves outpatient clinic reviews with       radiographs at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, three months and six months. Therefore, one additional       visit at 1 year is required for this study with no additional radiographs. Radiographs will       only be performed at one year on clinical indication.        At each visit physical examination, treatment, complications and re-operation e.g. hardware       removal, for each patient will be recorded. A member of the research team, blinded to the       treatment method by sticking plaster over the entry position, will undertake functional       testing and assessment.        By statistically analysing the outcome scores in the two groups, I aim to better determine       the optimal management of this fracture in this age group.

SUMMARY:       This study is to determine the anti-anginal and anti-ischemic effect of k-channel opener,       nicorandil in patients of chronic stable angina. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Stress myocardial perfusion imaging MPI is widely used for the diagnosis and risk       assessment of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease CAD. Also, MPI       lends itself to monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions such as anti-ischemic       medications, gene therapy, and various percutaneous and surgical revascularization       modalities.        The effects of nitrates, potassium channel activators, calcium-channel blockers, and       beta-blockers on myocardial perfusion imaging are likely attributable to changes in       myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio. The major anti-ischemic       effect of BBs is a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption both at rest and during       stress. Beta-blockers decrease myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate,       blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. They also prolong diastole, therefore       increasing coronary perfusion time. The effect of chronic atenolol use on dipyridamole SPECT       MPI was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study that showed no difference in       the perfusion defect size and severity between placebo and atenolol for the group as a       whole, although one-third of patients had larger defects on atenolol than placebo. Bridges       et al., 1992 56        Nicorandil, a potassium channel activator, when given for 3 weeks exhibited significant       improvement in myocardial perfusion in both MI and angina patients, on exercise thallium       scan. Yamazaki et al., 1993 69.        Atenolol as shown in the cross over study does not affect myocardial perfusion significantly       and hence combination therapy with nicorandil will help us to determine a significant       benefit of nicorandil on MP. Results will be analyzed from base line in the same arm and the       difference will be further compared with control arm.        Guidelines suggest beta blockers as first line of therapy. To assess the anti ischemic       effects of nicorandil, combination therapy with atenolol will be compared with atenolol       alone. Since atenolol effect on MP is insignificant an added advantage of nicorandil can be       evaluated in comparative study.        Primary objective is to assess the anti ischemic effect of nicorandil.        The primary endpoint is to compare the anti ischemic effect over 4 weeks period.        Changes in perfusion will be evaluated in each arm at week 4 and comparison between the two       study arms will be made to document the anti ischemic effects of nicorandil.        Primary efficacy variables of the study are the difference of the following endpoints from       the baseline at week 4 and comparison between control and study arm using Ex- SPECT MPI.        Secondary efficacy variables of the study are the difference of the following endpoints from       the baseline and comparison between control and study arm using ETT Bruce Protocol at week       4.        Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the anti anginal effect and safety of       Nicorandil.        This is an open label, randomized controlled pilot study. Sponsor of this study is Ferozsons       Labs. Ltd. All participating patients must sign a written informed consent form.        Eligible patients with proven CAD having at least one reversible or partially reversible       myocardial perfusion defects on MPI SPECT - Tc-99m and functional class I & II of CSA, and       laboratory values within predefined safety limits will be recruited.        Chief exclusion criteria include presence of only fixed perfusion defects, CSA functional       class III and IV and prior revascularization.        A total of 40 patients will be enrolled in the study, 20 patients in each arm. Patients       will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive beta blocker in combination with nicorandil       experiment arm or beta blocker control arm for four weeks until unacceptable toxicity,       withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.        Nicorandil dose will be titrated from 10mg bd for 7days to 20mg bd for next 3 weeks.       Concurrent therapy for angina attacks will be allowed to be used with study medication.

This study uses an internet       based survey to ask individuals how they obtained medical care in the midst of a heart       attack. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals stricken with a heart attack       prevents them from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based medical care in       a timely manner to reduce the long term health consequences of a heart attack. By using a       self-tailoring survey instrument the study attempts to take into consideration the complex       social processes by which the individual and their family make decisions to seek medical       care for symptoms of a heart attack. The study is designed to obtain a national sample of       ACS care-seeking behavior in the United States. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of care-seeking behavior       surrounding acute coronary syndromes [ACS] through the application and testing of an       integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] and the utilization of a world wide web       [WWW] based ISCM survey instrument. At present, care-seeking delay among individuals       stricken with ACS [acute myocardial infarction [AMI], unstable angina or sudden cardiac       death] prevents many patients from obtaining the full therapeutic benefit of hospital based       thrombolytic and/or mechanical reperfusion therapy to reduce the morbid and mortal       consequences of acute cardiovascular disease [CVD]. Results from prior studies of ACS       care-seeking delay generally rely on measures of time duration from acute symptom onset       [ASO] to hospital emergency department [ED] arrival and measures of social demographic and       clinical variables, extracted from emergency medical system [EMS] logs and/or ED charts. By       relying on such limited data sources, these studies have failed to take into consideration       the complexity of the social and behavioral processes by which individuals make decisions to       seek medical care for symptoms of ACS.        By applying and testing an integrated self-regulatory care-seeking model [ISCM] to ACS       care-seeking, it will be possible to delineate decision points and situations and       circumstances that are critical to producing patterns of care-seeking that are efficient and       expeditious or are protracted and delayed. The care-seeking process in the ISCM is viewed in       terms of five analytic care-seeking phases from warning or premonitory symptoms to ED       arrival. By noting the presence or absence of three central phases, it is possible to       distinguish patterns of care-seeking and to record the duration of each care-seeking phase       and total duration of each care-seeking path to the ED. The ISCM assumes that coping       behaviors emerge over time and initially care-seeking behaviors are guided by demographic       and structural factors. As the self-regulatory and coping processes emerge over the course       of the ACS episode, the influence of these factors diminishes and emergent ACS evaluations,       advice from others and health care providers, emerging symptoms and emotions, come to       dominate the care-seeking process and directly determine the duration of ACS care-seeking.       The study will test and explore the following hypotheses:          1. Commonly used demographic variables, such as, age, sex, education and race will prove            to be only one component, along with social situational and circumstantial, cognitive            and emotional variables, that significantly influence the course and duration of ACS            care-seeking.          2. The ISCM will show that decision process variables associated with the care-seeking            phases, the Self, Lay and Health Care Provider Phases, as shown in the Figure, are            important predictors of time from symptoms onset to ED arrival and in the prediction of            the length of time spent in each care-seeking phase.          3. The ISCM will show differences in the total duration of the 5 most frequently occurring            care-seeking paths to the ED and will explain most of the differences by the variables            in Hypotheses 1 and 2.          4. Conditional models of subjects who use key care-seeking phases, namely the Self, Lay            and Health Care Provider Phases, will identify unique predictors of time in each phase.          5. Significant interaction effects [model coefficient differences] will be found for            important risk variables and socially important gender, age and racial groups. For            example, African-Americans will show differences in model coefficients from            Non-African-Americans.        The proposed study utilizes a twice tested pilot ISCM survey instrument placed on two secure       dedicated web servers to collect patient care-seeking data. The target sample size for this       study is 2,314 patients who have experienced an ACS episode. Subjects will be recruited       using: 1] extensive marketing of the study URL on websites of interest to cardiac patients       and oriented toward cardiac health and ACS risks, such as, diabetes or hypertension; 2]       placement of study information on discussion boards and chat rooms with a cardiac health       focus; 3] emailing of a study flyer PDF for posting in public libraries, senior citizen       centers, African-American churches, county and municipal health clinics, and HMO web sites;       4] application of a viral marketing strategy; and 5] use of selected print media, for       example, AARP publications. Marketing of the study site URL will emphasize the recruitment       of women, the elderly and minorities. In the data collection phase of the study, the       proportions of myocardial infarction and angina pectoris subjects falling into each cell of       the cross classification of age, sex and race will be derived from NHANES 1999-2000 and       2001-2002 studies. These estimates of the population proportions in these cells will be used       to determine quotas for each of the cells in an attempt to ensure all risk groups are       adequately represented. We will over sample African-Americans. Statistical models will be       used to estimate the effects of variables that characterize the decision process on the time       delay until ED arrival. Time required to move from one phase of the decision process to the       next will also be modeled, as will the different paths chosen by the subjects. Models will       also include patient characteristics and other circumstantial and situational variables in       the decision process.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01428817","TITLE:       Carbetocin at Elective Cesarean Delivery Part 2 SUMMARY:       Post-partum hemorrhage PPH is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the       most common uterotonic drug used to prevent and treat PPH in North America, however, there       are some limitations to its use. Oxytocin has a very short duration of action, which       requires a continuous infusion to achieve sustained uterotonic activity. The Society of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada SOGC has recently recommended a single 100mcg       dose of carbetocin at elective Cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction and prevent       post partum hemorrhage PPH, in lieu of the more traditional oxytocin regimens. Carbetocin       lasts 4 to 7 times longer than oxytocin, with a similar side effect profile and apparent       greater efficacy rate. However, a dose response to determine the minimum effective dose of       carbetocin has not yet been published. The investigators hypothesize that the minimum       effective dose ED90 is above 20mcgs and below 80mcgs in women undergoing elective Cesarean       delivery. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada SOGC recently recommended a       100mcg intravenous bolus dose of carbetocin following Cesarean delivery.        Studies thus far show that carbetocin may be just as effective as oxytocin in promoting       uterine contraction, with a similar side effect profile. In addition, patients receiving       carbetocin may experience less blood loss, and require less additional uterotonics when       compared with oxytocin. A dose response study conducted by Cordovani et al suggested no       difference in efficacy of uterine contraction for doses of carbetocin between 80-120mcg.       Additionally, hypotension was noted for all dose groups studied.        The results of this follow-up study will define the minimum required dose of carbetocin for       uterine contraction, thus minimizing unnecessary side effects, improving quality and safety       of patient care. It may also contribute in establishing carbetocin as a substitute to       oxytocin for elective cesarean section at our institution as well as others.

Drug-eluting stents have been shown to decrease       neointimal hyperplasia and to reduce the rate of restenosis and target-lesion       revascularization as compared to bare-metal stents. Drug-eluting stents consist of a       metallic platform and a therapeutic substance that is usually released from a polymer       matrix. A previous study utilizing a bioresorbable polymer has demonstrated a favorable       safety and efficacy profile in a large-scale clinical trial as compared to a       first-generation druf-eluting stent LEADERS trial.        The objective of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a sirolimus-eluting       stent with a biodegradable polymer with an everolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer       in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in patients       undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in routine clinical practice. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background        Coronary artery stents have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary       interventions compared with balloon angioplasty alone New Engl J Med 1994; 331:489-495.       Notwithstanding, restenosis is still encountered in 20 to 30% of lesions after implantation       of bare metal stents JAMA 2000; 284:1828-36 and may require repeat revascularization       procedures with a negative impact on quality of life and health care expenditures.       Drug-eluting stents with local, controlled release of therapeutic agents have addressed this       problem successfully Circulation 2003; 107:3003-7. Current drug-eluting stents consist of       a metallic stent platform and a therapeutic agent, which is either directly immobilized on       the stent surface or released from a polymer matrix. Polymers currently utilized for       drug-eluting stents are either biodegradable or non-biodegradable. While biodegradable       polymers are released together with the drug and dissolve after a certain period of time,       non-biodegradable polymers reside permanently on the stent surface.        First-generation drug-eluting stents utilized sirolimus and paclitaxel for prevention of       restenosis. Both drugs are highly lipophilic and show rapid and strong uptake in arterial       wall tissue. In addition, Sirolimus Circulation 2001; 104:852-5 and paclitaxel       Circulation 1997; 96:636-45 have been shown to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and       neointimal hyperplasia, the principal cause of restenosis after coronary stenting in       experimental models. A polymer-encapsulated stent releasing Sirolimus has been compared with       the respective bare metal stent in several randomized clinical trials, demonstrating a       consistent reduction in angiographic and clinical restenosis N Engl J Med 2002;       346:1773-80. Similarly, a polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent consistently reduced       restenosis and the need for repeated revascularization procedures compared with the       respective bare metal stent N Engl J Med 2004; 350:221-31. A meta-analysis of drug-eluting       stent trials confirmed the reduction in restenosis and repeat revascularization procedures       for polymer-based, drug-eluting stents Lancet 2004; 364:583-91. Moreover, the rates of       death and myocardial infarction were comparable to those with bare metal stents, attesting       to the safety of these devices, which have been approved by the US Food and Drug       Administration.        Newer generation drug-eluting stents with durable polymer coating utilize Limus analogues       such as everolimus, zotarolimus or novolimus. Everolimus-eluting stents have been compared       to first-generation drug-eluting stents in several randomized clinical trials. A pooled       analysis of the four largest randomized trials to date comparing everolimus-eluting stents       with paclitaxel-eluting stents demonstrated a lower rate of MACE 4.4% versus 7.6%,       myocardial infarction 2.1% vs. 4.0%, p<0.001, ischemic TLR 2.3% vs. 4.7%, p<0.001, and       definite stent thrombosis 0.4% vs. 1.2%, p<0.001 in favor of EES, whereas there was no       difference with regard to overall and cardiac mortality Stone GW.

This project is aimed to confirm the       hypothesis that increased concentrations of circulatory angiotensin II after angiotensin II       receptor type I AT1 blockade leads, via stimulation of angiotensin II receptor type II       AT2, to activation of adipogenesis and improvement of insulin sensitivity. Therefore, in       hypertensive patients, the components of RAS and the parameters of insulin sensitivity on       systemic in plasma and local in adipose tissue and in its interstitial fluid level will       be studied. The main aim of the study is to identify the changes occurring in patient before       and 6 months after the conversion of therapy from angiotensin converting enzyme ACE       inhibitors to AT1 receptor blockers. Observed parameters will include gene expression of RAS       components, parameters of insulin sensitivity, amount, and cellularity of adipose tissue       obtained by biopsy, evaluation of direct production of cytokines and angiotensins into the       interstitial fluid of fat tissue obtained by microdialysis and evaluation of the selected       parameters in plasma. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Arterial hypertension is nowadays considered a metabolic disease, due to its occurrence       together with other risk factors of atherosclerosis like obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin       resistance, impaired glucose regulation to diabetes mellitus type 2. These factors often       result into the metabolic syndrome. Its pathogenetic mechanisms are not completely clarified       yet, polygenic inheritance and environmental factors are probably involved. Therefore, from       pathophysiological perspective of hypertension therapy a complex approach to the patient is       needed. This approach requires the understanding of all known risk factors leading to the       pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention aimed to eliminate the risk factors of       atherosclerosis. One of the main homeostatic systems participating in blood pressure       regulation is the RAS.        The present pharmacotherapy provides the possibility to influence the RAS through the       inhibition of a renin, bACE or c through blockade of AT1 receptors.          1. Renin inhibitors belong to the recent therapeutic approaches in hypertension treatment.            Clinical studies, which could enable their use in daily practice, have not been            completed yet.          2. Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme prevents the transformation of angiotensin            I Ang I to angiotensin II Ang II, prevents the breakdown of vasodilatatory kinins,            mainly bradykinin, leading to the NO-mediated vasodilatation. The positive effects of            therapy with ACE inhibitors are based besides the decrease of circulating Ang II also            on decreased influence of tissue Ang II, mainly in the vascular wall and on diminished            norepinephrine release from neural terminals of autonomic nervous system Noshiro et            al. 1991. The ACE inhibitors reduce plasma Ang II levels, thus the AT1 and AT2            receptors are less stimulated by the hormone leading to upregulation of the homologue            ACE2, thereby increasing the production of angiotensin 1-7 Ferrario et al. 2005.            Angiotensin 1-7 binds to the AT1 as well as to the AT2 receptors and to its tentative            AT1-7 receptor.             Some ACE inhibitors have a positive effect on improvement of glucose metabolism. The            mechanism of improvement of insulin sensitivity has not been completely explained yet.            It is supposed, that the positive insulin-sensitizing effects of ACE inhibitors could            be mediated by hemodynamic changes - by improvement of skeletal muscle blood flow            and/or by stimulation of insulin signaling pathways or by increasing the expression and            the number of glucose transporter GLUT4. The improvement of insulin sensitivity during            the therapy with ACE inhibitors correlated with the changes in the ion            calcium/magnesium balance. The sympatholytic effect of the therapy with RAS inhibitors            could also positively influence the metabolic parameters, supported by a study showing            a decrease in serum epinephrine and an increase of insulin stimulated glucose uptake in            normotensive volunteers treated with ACE inhibitor. In animal models of hypertension,            the ACE inhibitors had a positive effect on reduction of free fatty acids levels and            therefore a positive effect on insulin action.          3. AT1 receptor blockade by sartans results in elevated plasma Ang II concentrations and            to preferential stimulation of AT2 receptors. Compared to AT1, stimulation of AT2            receptors exerts an antagonistic effect by inducing vasodilatation, apoptosis, and by            inhibiting growth and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, high            Ang II concentrations seem to upregulate low levels or even re-express missing AT2            receptors in adult rat adipose tissue. ACE2 expression is also upregulated under AT1            blockade thus increased concentrations of angiotensin 1-7 in vivo in humans are            assumed even not studied yet. Angiotensin 1-7 binds preferentially to non-blocked AT2            receptors evoking additional depressor activity via kinin/NO/cGMP cascade inducing            vasodilatation and improvement in hemodynamics.        Overall, ACE inhibition exerts its beneficial effects on blood pressure via decreased Ang II       concentrations and elevated bradykinin. On the other hand, blockade of AT1 receptors causes       simultaneous overstimulation of AT2 receptors by elevated concentrations of Ang II,       angiotensin 1-7 and angiotensin A having a positive effect on adipogenesis resulting in       changes of regulatory mechanisms influencing the insulin action.        The sartans have an insulin-sensitizing effect; their exact mechanism is unknown so far.       Some of the AT1 receptor blockers display a weak peroxisome proliferator activator receptor       PPARγ agonist activity which might promote the adipocyte differentiation. However, sartans       without the PPARγ-agonist activity have a significant effect on adipocyte downsizing and       improvement of insulin sensitivity markers as well. These results suggest that there may be       a distinct mechanism, other than direct activation of PPARγ that is responsible for       adipocyte differentiation and improvement of metabolic parameters.        It is supposed that adipose tissue, except from systemic hemodynamic and sympatholytic       effect is responsible for the insulin-sensitizing effect of sartans. In the last 20 years,       the adipose tissue has been well studied, since it is no more considered only an energy       storage but also a source of several substances - hormones, enzymes and bioactive peptides       generally called adipokines.        Human and rat adipose tissue contains complete local renin-angiotensin system RAS.       Components of adipose RAS undergo significant changes when the amount of adipose tissue and       the adipocyte size enlarge. This leads to the assumption, that RAS plays an important role       in regulation of adipose tissue mass. In vitro studies showed that Ang II inhibits adipocyte       differentiation resulting in increased proportion of large insulin-resistant adipocytes and       ectopic lipid deposition in other tissues. In the large adipocytes, expression and       production of TNF is increased and adiponectin secretion inhibited through AT1 receptors.       TNF is a cytokine impairing insulin action, highly expressed in adipose tissue in obesity       and metabolic syndrome. It is known that the insulin sensitivity of adipocytes decreases       with their size. RAS blockade stimulates adipogenesis in adipose tissue, probably via       stimulation of AT2 receptors resulting in increased number of small insulin-sensitive cells.       Several authors have observed a decrease in adipocyte size in retroperitoneal and epididymal       adipose tissue in line with improved insulin sensitivity after RAS blockade in rats.       Blockade of AT1 receptors in co-culture of human preadipocytes and adipocytes leaded also to       increased adipogenesis. It is assumed that in vivo blockade of RAS might result in increased       proportion of small adipocytes due to adipogenesis with simultaneous decrease in number of       large cells due to apoptosis. The increased proportion of smaller adipocytes is reflected in       changes of expression and release of adipokines producing more adiponectin and less TNF.       Indeed, blockade of RAS elevates serum concentrations of adiponectin in patients with       essential hypertension. In rats, serum concentrations as well as mRNA expression of       adiponectin and PPARγ in adipose tissue increased. PPARγ plays probably a role in mechanisms       related to the effect of RAS inhibition on changes in adipose tissue amount and its insulin       sensitivity. In vivo in human body, to our knowledge these changes in production of RAS       components in relation to adiposity and cellularity of the adipose tissue, to adipokines       secretion and to parameters of insulin sensitivity have not been studied yet.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Acute mountain sickness AMS is a pathological effect of high altitude on humans caused by       acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. It commonly occurs above       2500 meters of altitude. AMS appears as a collection of nonspecific symptoms acquired at       high altitude or in low air pressure resembling a case of flu, carbon monoxide poisoning,       or a hangover.        It is caused by a drop in pressure and lowering partial pressure of oxygen during increasing       altitude. The direct consequence of those changes is a hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction       Euler-Lijestrand-mechanism. In addition a rise in pulmonary blood pressure Hypertonia       can occur so that there is a higher risk of developing a high altitude pulmonary edema       HAPE.        In this investigation the investigators are exploring whether different types of breathing       procedures can improve the peripheral oxygen saturation. We are comparing breathing with no       regulation with two different procedures of hyperventilation during trekking in different       altitudes. Procedure 1 hyperventilation 1 describes inhalation during one step and       exhalation during the next step. Procedure 2 hyperventilation 2 describes inhalation and       exhalation during one step.        The effect of the different breathing procedures can be quantified measuring the peripheral       oxygen saturation. In addition the investigators are comparing the breathing rate and the       minute ventilation as well as the expiratory end-tidal CO2-partial pressure of the three       different breathing procedures.        Furthermore, the investigators are examining the ability to concentrate in order to quantify       the effect of AMS on organ functions.

SUMMARY:       Anti-aggregation therapy, including treatment with low-dose aspirin LDA is an established       risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage, including chronic subdural hematoma CSDH; however       evidence guiding the decision to continue or discontinue LDA in patients who have sustained       mild head trauma with no sign of injury on CT is lacking. The investigators aim to assess       whether continued aspirin treatment increases the risk of CSDH in mild head trauma patients       50 years and older who present with negative head CT. The investigators further aim to use       the initial findings to refine the study design, with the goal of performing a larger,       multi-institutional study in the future.        Over a 12-month period, approximately 100 patients ≥50 years of age on LDA prophylaxis       presenting to Hadassahs Emergency Department after sustaining mild head injury, will be       examined by the neurosurgeon on call. Those who have no sign of intracranial hemorrhage at       clinical or CT examination, and who meet inclusion / exclusion criteria, will be invited to       participate in a randomized study. Informed consent will be obtained. Patients will be       remotely randomized for continuation or cessation of LDA treatment. Follow-up CT and       clinical examination will be performed 3-5 weeks after trauma.        The two-proportions test will be used to assess whether there is a statistically significant       difference in the rate of CSDH in patients randomized to cessation of LDA therapy and those       randomized to continuation of LDA. Relationships between the explanatory the dependent       variables will be explored with classical parametric and nonparametric statistical methods,       including multivariate analysis, logistic regression, the two proportions test, and the       independence test. Several measures of association/correlation between pairs of variables       will be analyzed as well.        The investigators hypothesize that continuation of LDA will not be associated with increased       risk for chronic subdural hematoma, and that cessation of treatment will not be associated       with a decrease in chronic subdural hematoma. The investigators further hypothesize that       cessation of LDA for this period will not be associated with increased risk for clinically       significant cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, thrombotic, of embolic event. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Scientific Background Chronic subdural hematoma CSDH is a well-described sequelae of minor       head trauma in the elderly population. Known risk factors for the development of this       condition are old age, previous bleed, intracranial hypotension, and anticoagulant or       antiaggregant therapy prior to the trauma [1-3, 10].        Anti-aggregation therapy, including treatment with low-dose aspirin LDA is an established       risk factor for the development of a CSDH. Among patients presenting with a chronic subdural       hematoma, 16-76% have a history of antiaggregation therapy [6, 9, 13], however it remains       unclear whether the increased risk is related to treatment prior to the trauma or to the       continued treatment with LDA after the trauma, while the hematoma is supposedly developing.        This has implications for daily clinical practice. It is unclear whether continued       antiaggregation therapy after a minor head trauma increases the risk for development of a       CSDH, and therefore it is unclear whether cessation of such treatment after a minor head       trauma is indicated.        We aim to assess whether continued aspirin treatment increases the risk of CSDH in mild head       trauma patients 50 years and older who present with negative head CT.        Brief Review of the Literature The risk of bleeding complications associated with LDA       prophylaxis has been extensively reported. In 2006, McQuaide and Laine [4] performed a       systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relative and absolute risk of clinically       relevant adverse events in patients treated with LDA or clopidogrel for cardiovascular       prophylaxis. They included randomized controlled trials comparing cardiovascular outcomes       and adverse events in patients treated with placebo, LDA, and clopidogrel from 1966-2004 in       their analysis. The authors found a very modest 0.3% 3 patients per thousand increase in       the absolute risk of intracranial bleeding associated with the use of aspirin, although CSDH       in the wake of head trauma was not specifically discussed.        A year earlier, Serebruany et al [11] compared the risk of hemorrhage associated with <       100mg, 100-200mg, and > 200mg doses of aspirin in a meta-analysis of 31 studies involving       192,036 patients. They reported major bleeding events intracranial bleeding; overt bleeding       with decrease ≥ 5g/dl in hemoglobin or ≥ 15% in hematocrit in 1.5% of patients on doses <       100 mg, 1.5% of patients at 100-200 mg, and 2.3% of patients on the highest dose. Incidence       of CSDH was not reported.        Aspirin has been associated with an increased risk for postoperative intracranial hemorrhage       [5, 7], and CSDH [13] However in spite of the strong evidence that aspirin treatment       increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, there is a surprising dearth of research       guiding the decision to continue or discontinue aspirin in patients who have sustained mild       head trauma with no sign of injury on CT.        Tauber et al [14] recently assessed the incidence of secondary intracranial hemorrhage in a       prospective study of 100 mild head trauma patients 65 years and older on LDA prophylaxis.       Primary CT scan in all participants revealed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Repeat       CT, performed within 12-24 hours, revealed secondary intracranial hemorrhage leading to       death in one patient, surgical intervention in one, and conservative management with an       uneventful clinical course in two patients. The authors recommended repeat CT after 12-24       hours or 48-hour in-hospital observation for elderly patients on LDA prophylaxis.        In 2003, Spektor et al. investigated the role of LDA prophylaxis in the evolvement of acute       traumatic findings after a mild-to-moderate head injury [12]. They evaluated 231 patients,       comparing those on aspirin treatment to those who were not. Interestingly, the authors found       no significant increase in the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving       prophylactic LDA treatment, however they did not assess the incidence of delayed bleeding.        In 1992, Reymond et al reviewed the characteristics of 39 patients who developed chronic       subdural hematoma in a population of 198 patients admitted after severe head trauma with       various forms of intracranial bleeding on original CT [8]. They found that risk factors for       intracranial hemorrhage were age, alcohol consumption, and anticoagulation or       antiaggregation therapy. Five 13% patients with chronic subdural hematoma had been treated       with aspirin. The authors concluded that patients on prophylactic LDA treatment are at risk       of developing chronic subdural hematoma.        Several other studies retrospectively evaluated the role of LDA treatment in the evolution       of chronic subdural hematomas. The proportion of patients with chronic subdural hematoma who       were treated by aspirin varied widely. OBrien et al reported treatment w LDA in 93 of 123       76% patients with spontaneous hematomas [6]. On the other end of the scale, Rust et al.       reported this treatment in only 18 of 81 patients 22% [9] and Stroobandt in 16 of 100       16% [13].        Two studies reported no effect of aspirin treatment on the recurrence rate of chronic       subdural hematomas after drainage. Torohashi et al [15] retrospectively reviewed 343       consecutive patients treated with surgical drainage for CSDH and subsequent recurrence.       Patients were advised to discontinue anticoagulation and antiaggregation for one week after       initial drainage. The authors found no statistically significant relationship between       anticoagulation or antiaggregation therapy and recurrence of CSDH, however recurrence       occurred with a shorter interval in patients treated with anticoagulation or antiaggregation       therapy.        Research Objectives Assess whether continuation of low-dose aspirin therapy increases risk       for development of chronic subdural hematoma in the 3-5 weeks following mild head trauma in       patients 50 years and above.        Assess whether cessation of LDA therapy decreases the risk for development of chronic       subdural hematoma in the 3-5 weeks following mild head injury in patients 50 years and       above.        Assess whether cessation of LDA therapy is associated with an increase in clinically       significant adverse events, including myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, or       vascular or thrombo-embolic events in the 3-5 weeks following mild head trauma in patients       50 years and above.        Establish a study protocol that may serve as the basis of a larger and more definitive       multi-institutional study.        We hypothesize that continuation of LDA will not increase the risk of CSDH in the 3-5 week       follow-up period after minor head trauma.        We hypothesize that discontinuation of LDA for 3-5 weeks will not be associated with an       increase in the number of in clinically significant cardiovascular events.        Expected Significance There is currently no consensus regarding the continuation or       cessation of prophylactic aspirin treatment following mild head trauma in patients with no       immediate evidence of hemorrhagic injury. The evidence-based knowledge that will be gained       in this study, and from larger multi-institutional studies will have significant clinical       implications.        Methods All patients seen in Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centers Department of       Emergency Medicine after head trauma are examined by the neurosurgeon on call. A complete       history is taken, and patients undergo a thorough physical and neurological examination.       Patients reporting to the Emergency Department after mild trauma who are treated with LDA at       the time of injury are routinely referred for immediate non-contrast head CT. Blood tests to       assess prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, INR, and platelet count are performed.       A detailed history is taken to ascertain the reason for aspirin therapy. Patients with head       CT that is negative for traumatic findings, and with normal neurologic examination or no       change from neurological baseline before trauma, are discharged from the emergency       department. The policy regarding continuation or discontinuation of LDA after mild head       trauma is not well established.        We propose to offer patients aged 50 and above who suffer mild head trauma, who are on LDA       therapy 75-100 mg at time of trauma, who have normal neurological examination or no change       from neurological baseline before trauma, no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on initial       CT, and who meet other inclusion and exclusion criteria, participation in a randomized trial       to assess the effects of aspirin continuation versus aspirin cessation.        Intake- and follow-up examinations will be completed according to standard forms that will       be used by all physicians involved in the care of participants in the study Appendix 1-2.       Informed consent will be obtained Appendix 3. Patients will be randomized. An attending       neuroradiologist will read the admission CT. Patients with a finding of intracranial       hemorrhage, or possible intracranial hemorrhage will be excluded from the study and followed       appropriately by a physician from the Department of Neurosurgery.        Two weeks after injury, a study nurse will contact patients by telephone, to schedule       follow-up CT and clinic evaluation, with follow-up reminders as needed. Follow-up clinical /       neurological examination and head CT will be performed 3-5 weeks after injury. Achieving       follow-up CT 3-5 weeks after the injury is routine in the patients population included in       this study.        At final assessment participants will be evaluated for clinical or imaging evidence of CSDH       as well as other intracranial hemorrhage, or cardiac, thrombotic, or embolic condition. In       the case of a clinically significant adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event, the       IRB will be notified, and the patient will be treated as appropriate for the clinical       situation. At study completion, LDA prophylaxis will be prescribed for individual patients       as clinically indicated, with cardiology or other consultation as appropriate.        Informed Consent The attending neurosurgeon will fully explain the basis for the study and       its clinical importance, as well as the risks involved with the continuation or cessation of       LDA prophylaxis, and invite the eligible patient to participate in the study. Eligible       patients who are fully conscious and who agree to participate in the study, or their legally       authorized representatives, will be asked to sign an informed consent form Appendix 3.       Patients with no legal guardian who suffer from dementia or any other concurrent illness       which prevents them from giving informed consent, will be excluded from the study.        Randomization Randomization of all participants will be performed remotely via an online       program.        Patients in arm 1 will be requested to continue their aspirin therapy according to previous       instructions; those in arm 2 will be requested to cease aspirin therapy for the initial 3-5       weeks following their mild head trauma.        Primary Endpoint          -  Occurrence of CSDH Secondary Endpoints          -  Intervention for surgical evacuation of CSDH          -  Occurrence of other clinically significant intracranial hemorrhage          -  Intervention for surgical evacuation of other intracranial hemorrhage          -  Occurrence of clinically significant cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, thrombolic, or            embolic event          -  Intervention for treatment of cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, thrombolic, or embolic            event        The possible relationship between LDA prophylaxis and a variety of other demographic and       clinical variables will also be assessed, including patient age and gender, coagulation       profile, mechanism of injury, loss of consciousness, and time elapse from traumatic head       injury to any clinically significant sequelae. We will assess the relationship between       aspirin cessation and incidence of clinically significant events in patients with ischemic       heart disease.        Statistical Analysis Since the incidence of CSDH in patients on LDA is has not been studied       directly, it is not currently possible to estimate the number of patients required to       achieve statistical power for this research. Study enrollment will continue through the       first year, with an estimated 100 participants in this period. Based on preliminary findings       at that point, we expect to determine the total required study population.        The two-proportions test will be used to assess whether there is a statistically significant       difference in the rate of CSDH in patients randomized to cessation of LDA therapy and those       randomized to continuation of LDA. Relationships between the explanatory the dependent       variables will be explored with classical parametric and nonparametric statistical methods,       including multivariate analysis, logistic regression, the two proportions test, and the       independence test. Several measures of association/correlation between pairs of variables       will be analyzed as well.        With the pilot data from 100 patients, our statistician will be consulted to perform a power       analysis to assess the required sample size to have a greater than 80% chance of detecting a       significant difference between the two groups at significance level of p < 0.05.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Current recommendations on the treatment of acute coronary syndrome ACS dictate urgent       reperfusion therapy in the case of evolving myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation       STEMI. Optimal use of PCI preferably or thrombolysis in this situation requires a rapid       and correct diagnosis.        According to the ESC2008 and ACC/AHA2009 focused update guidelines patients admitted to       the hospital within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain with new or presumably new left       bundle-branch block LBBB should be treated like patients having STEMI class I, level A.       However, it is well-known that in patients with concomitant LBBB, the ECG manifestations of       acute myocardial injury may be masked.        ACS may occur in a patient with true old LBBB when doctor has/has not an ability to       compare the new ECG with the previous one or presumably new LBBB.        There is a high risk of non receiving appropriate therapy or of receiving inappropriate       therapy thrombolysis instead of LMWH/UFH/fondaparinux.

At present the standard care of hospitalized       children with bronchiolitis is oxygen via nasal prongs. In this study the investigators       would like to compare standard ward management with a new method of delivering oxygen called       high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy HFNOT. HFNOT involves breathing warmed, moistened       oxygen through nasal cannulae at a flow rate of 8 liters/minute. Accumulated experience       suggests that HFNOT eases the childs work of breathing and reduces need for ICU admission       and invasive respiratory support. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       We propose a prospective open randomised controlled trial to compare high flow nasal cannula       oxygen therapy HFNOT with standard oxygen therapy for infants hospitalised with       bronchiolitis. This study will be the first of its kind, as currently there is no evidence       in the published literature.        All children will be cared for by the same medical team on two wards. All aspects of care       other than oxygen delivery will not be specified, and be at the discretion of the       physicians. HFNOT will not be used as an escalation of care on the wards.        Randomisation will be performed by REDcap, in blocks of 6 patients. Patients will be       identified in Emergency, informed consent obtained, and treatment started prior to transfer       to the ward.        For patients randomised to HFNOT, the flow rate will be fixed at 8 liters/minute, and the       inspired oxygen concentration titrated to maintain saturations above 92%.        Interim statistical analysis will be conducted to determine any positive or negative effect       of HFNOT therapy. The first interval analysis will be performed after 50 subjects, the       second after 100 subjects. If an effect is found, the study will be terminated following       discussion with the hospital statistician and ethics board. Whichever treatment arm is found       to be beneficial will be instituted as standard care for children with bronchiolitis. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  All children under 18 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis              requiring admission to hospital for observation and oxygen.

The project is based on the cooperation of a national private company DiaSorin, endowed       with promising proprietary technologies in the novel diagnostic biotechnologies and three       research units at clinical and molecular biology level two from the National Research       Council IFC-CNR, Pisa and ITB-CNR, Milano, both very active in advanced biological       research and one from the University Vita-Salute San Raffaele UHSR, Milano, operating a       top range hospital and center for advanced biological research: GENOCOR Lab becomes then       the first product of the cooperation within the CNR MERIT Network MEdical Reseach in ITaly       currently being set-up by CNR.        The project is based on the availability of proprietary large scale databases of selected       clinical populations that will be probed with the novel genomic and post-genomic       technologies. High throughput SNPs technologies and post-genomic expression and proteomic       analyses will be used to assess profiles of genetic variability identifying subjects with a       distinct proneness to ischemic heart disease IHD, hard cardiovascular events and       unfavourable outcomes. Specific focusing will be made possible by the availability, within       the proposed research network, of well established clinical data bases and biological sample       collections, enabling the retrospective and prospective access to large and well       characterised populations of patients with IHD. Cardiovascular phenotypes will include       patients with acute coronary syndromes unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction and       patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and prolonged follow-up; with this approach, it       will be possible to cover both short-term and long-term evolution by detailed clinical,       biohumoral and instrumental phenotyping at the time of acute events and with a systematic       follow-up.        This approach should allow to overcome the major limitations and unbalance of previous       studies, either focussed to small well characterized populations in which few genetic       variations have been explored, or extended to large populations with a wider gene       variability approach but inadequate information on phenotype and evolution disease.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       PiCCO comprises techniques of pulse contour analysis and transpulmonary thermodilution, and       can provide important information on hemodynamics and pulmonary functions. It has been       widely used in critical care settings for several decades. Together with pulmonary artery       catheter PAC, it is regarded as the important tool for guiding fluid management in       patients with shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome. During last two decades, many       well designed clinical trials have been conducted to see whether the use of PAC would       benefit patient outcome. The result consistently showed that PAC added no benefit in terms       of mortality, ICU length of stay, organ failure free survival days, and the length of       mechanical ventilation.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01535248","TITLE:       Echo Detection of Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ERCP Air Embolus SUMMARY:       Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ERCP is an endoscopy technique to visualize       and evaluate the pancreatic and biliary systems. It has been reported that rare instances of       air embolus have been found associated with the performance of an ERCP and many of these       events are fatal. It is our proposal to use transthoracic echocardiography to continuously       evaluate for the presence of intra-cardiac air secondary to ERCP venous air embolism and       attempt to quantify the incidence of this complication and any potential patient factors       that might increase the risk of this complication. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ERCP is commonly used in the diagnosis and       treatment of biliary and pancreatic disease. There are case reports presented in the       literature demonstrating adverse and often fatal events following air embolization       associated with the performance of ERCP. The frequency of air embolus is extremely rare with       the exact incidence unknown. In recent years the utilization of echocardiography to evaluate       individuals with hemodynamic instability has led to the discovery of intracardiac air       embolus seen in those individuals that demonstrated changes in either hemodynamic parameters       or capnography values. There exists proposed mechanisms for the translocation of air from       the foregut to the systemic venous circulation but not one of these mechanisms has yet been       validated. Some proposed mechanisms include either through intrahepatic mechanisms where air       crosses from the biliary tract to hepatic venules or potentially from the foregut into the       portal vein and through shunt vessels into systemic venous circulation.        The exact frequency of air embolus is likely higher than the incidence of fatal or       near-fatal complications reported in the literature. Individuals that had the best outcomes       were usually intubated and had capnography to demonstrate a change suggestive of air embolus       prior to significant hemodynamic changes.1 As this phenomenon has not previously been well       described, it is possible that other patients suffer significant air embolus with myocardial       or cerebral ischemic sequelae that were not recognized because echocardiography was not used       as an early tool for evaluation of hemodynamically unstable patients. It is also possible       that there are a number of patients that may suffer a venous air embolus from ERCP that is       sub-clinical and therefore not causing enough change in cardiac function to alter either       hemodynamic parameters or capnography values. The literature suggests that if a patient does       not awake following ERCP, that imaging modalities, such as echocardiography be employed for       evaluation.1 Understanding the frequency of this problem or which subgroups are at risk can       further aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this complication.        Transthoracic echocardiography is a highly sensitive imaging modality and if adequate       imaging windows can be obtained will demonstrate the presence of intracardiac air. The risk       of performing the study on the patient is zero to very low. The potential risk of inaccurate       interpretation should be avoided by the use of trained individuals in the acquisition and       interpretation of transthoracic echocardiographic images.        The purpose of this study is to 1 identify individuals scheduled to undergo elective ERCP       as part of their plan-of-care and perform transthoracic echocardiography for surveillance of       intracardiac air embolus 2 record aspects of their past medical history that may       potentially contribute to increased risk of systemic venous air embolus. This evaluation has       not been presented in the literature and the primary end-point of this study would be to       determine the frequency at which venous air embolus associated with ERCP occurs.        All individuals that meet inclusion criteria will be approached and consented in the       pre-operative area prior to the planned procedure ERCP. Their past medical history will be       reviewed with the patient and special attention placed on particular co-morbid conditions       that might be related to this phenomenon including but not limited to: portal hypertension,       cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, and recent liver biopsy. The patient will then proceed to       the procedure room as planned and while the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus       position and induced under anesthesia. An echocardiography-trained anesthesiologist will       perform a transthoracic echocardiogram TTE concurrently while the gastroenterologist is       performing the ERCP. We plan on conducting serial images at least every ten to fifteen       minutes throughout the ERCP and more often as needed. At the conclusion of the procedure       ERCP if there are no significant findings on TTE the patient will be returned to the       supine position and taken to the recovery room. The written record of the TTE will then be       entered into the study database within a separate research chart. In the event that the TTE       shows the presence of intracardiac air embolus during the procedure the member of the study       group performing the TTE will notify the endoscopist and anesthesia provider of the findings       if the findings are significant enough to require a change in the patients medical care.       Reference to the algorithm will be made in each case and be available online if needed.       Unless a moderate to severe embolic event occurs, the findings will not be communicated to       the gastroenterologist so that he is blinded to the result maintained in the research chart.       The purpose of this is to keep clinically insignificant emboli from being reported in the       patients medical record.        One of the key components of this evaluation is determining whether the presence of an air       embolus has occurred and if so, has it had a negative effect on the function of the       subjects cardiovascular system. Our proposed evaluation of the myocardium using       transthoracic echocardiography includes evaluation of the left ventricle, right ventricle       and pulmonary artery pressures. In the event there is hemodynamic instability as a result of       impaired function of the right or left ventricle, an evaluation including measurements of       the following parameters will assist in determination of the problem:          1. Right ventricular function, specifically tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion            TAPSE and the presence of hemodynamic changes.          2. Left ventricular function, specifically diastolic function, systolic function and            myocardial performance index.          3. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure, via evaluation of the tricuspid regurgitant jet            maximum velocity using the modified Bernoulli equation.          4. Presence of a new right-to-left intracardiac shunt or bowing of the intraatrial septum            from right-to-left indicating a new increase in the right atrial pressure.          5. Significant changes in hemodynamic status that would indicate that the subject does not            have effective filling and ejection of the left ventricle to support a perfusing blood            pressure. This may manifest as hypotension and/or tachyarrhythmias on standard            intraoperative monitoring.        As this protocol evaluates the frequency and degree of air embolization into the systemic       venous system during the performance of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography       ERCP, the following four subgroups have been identified to help define the identification       and treatment of subjects enrolled into IRB 238-11. Each category has a criteria for the       visual quantification of the air seen and b the cardiac function and hemodynamic changes       seen and finally c the planned intervention if needed:          1. No air embolism:               1. No visualized air emboli during the procedure.               2. Subjects have no hemodynamic or myocardial changes attributable to the occurrence                 of venous air embolus.               3. No changes would be made to the standard care of this research subject as a result                 of the absence of findings. Findings will be entered into the research chart.          2. Small air embolism:               1. A small, but identifiable quantity of air visualized that does not form a large                 collection and does not obscure visualization of the far-field.               2. Subjects have no changes in myocardial function and maintenance of hemodynamics.               3. The subject would then undergo follow-up evaluation by a member of the study group                 at the conclusion of their normal post-op recovery period. No additional time                 would be required for evaluation and documentation of hemodynamic stability and                 follow-up echocardiography findings would be recorded in the research chart.          3. Moderate air embolism :               1. Identifiable intracardiac air within the heart that obscures the far-field due to                 its size but does not cause a sharp demarcation at the blood/gas interface.               2. Subjects have documented impairment of myocardial function and/or hemodynamics                 compared to baseline but do not require emergency resuscitation to correct.               3. The subject would remain in the left lateral decubitus safe position for                 individuals with suspected or confirmed venous air embolism for four hours.                 Laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes may be obtained and a member of the                 study team will re-evaluate with transthoracic echocardiography. If baseline                 function and hemodynamics return, the subject concludes their recovery period as                 per normal circumstance for ERCP. In the event the subject has persistent                 intracardiac air, impaired myocardial function or hemodynamic instability, it                 would be recommended that the subject stay for observation with telemetry                 monitoring and further evaluation as needed.          4. Large air embolism:               1. Identifiable intracardiac air which collects into a large enough bubble to cause                 sharp demarcation at the blood/gas interface and obscures the far-field.               2. Left and/or right ventricular failure with hemodynamic collapse.               3. The subject would require emergency resuscitation and ACLS protocol in addition to                 placement of invasive monitors for evaluation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       In a model of acute inflammation induced by salmonella typhi vaccination in healthy       volunteers, it has been shown that acute systemic inflammation increased arterial stiffness.       Since increased arterial stiffness assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity is an       independent prognosis marker of cardiovascular risk in many chronic diseases such as       hypertension, renal failure or diabetes mellitus, it could also be a marker of severity in       acute inflammation states. Severe sepsis is a leading cause of hospitalisation in intensive       care units, and constitutes a state of acute inflammation. It remains however to confirm       that arterial stiffness is increased in this clinical conditions before evaluating its       prognosis value.

Outcome measures including       the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index OSW, the percentage change of TrA and       IO muscle thickness i.e. muscle contraction from rest to contract utilizing ultrasound       imaging, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale NPRS for pain, and a subjective rating of overall       perceived improvement using the Global Rating of Change GROC scale will be collected.       Hypothesis: The OSW scores and NPRS scores will be lower for those who receive the       compression belt in addition to the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those       who receive the lumbopelvic stabilization alone. The percent change of muscle thickness for       the deep abdominals as well as the GROC scores will be higher for those who receive the       compression belt in addition to the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those       who receive the lumbopelvic stabilization alone. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background: The estimated prevalence of sacroiliac joint SIJ pain is approximately 13-30%       in patients with non-specific low back pain. One common presentation for those with SIJ pain       is unilateral pain over the SIJ region, which is described as a positive Fortins sign.       Common impairments for this population include pelvic asymmetry, lumbopelvic muscle       imbalance, and decreased lumbopelvic proprioceptive awareness and stability. Two common       physical therapy interventions for this population are lumbopelvic stabilization programs       and pelvic compression belts. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine       the usefulness of the addition of a pelvic compression belt to a lumbopelvic stabilization       program for patients with sacroiliac joint pain by comparing lumbopelvic stabilization       exercises with a pelvic compression belt to lumbopelvic stabilization exercises alone.       Participants: Thirty participants with unilateral pain near the SIJ will be recruited for       the study and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups stabilization plus belt or       stabilization alone. Both groups will receive a lumbopelvic stabilization program for 12       weeks. The stabilization plus belt group will also receive a pelvic compression belt to be       worn continuously for the first 4 weeks. Outcome measures including the Modified Oswestry       Low Back Pain Disability Index OSW, the percentage change of TrA and IO muscle thickness       i.e. muscle contraction from rest to contract utilizing ultrasound imaging, the Numeric       Pain Rating Scale NPRS for pain, and a subjective rating of overall perceived improvement       using the Global Rating of Change GROC scale will be collected. These outcomes will be       assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months post-intervention. Hypothesis: The OSW scores       and NPRS scores will be lower for those who receive the compression belt in addition to the       lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those who receive the lumbopelvic       stabilization alone. The percent change of muscle thickness for the deep abdominals as well       as the GROC scores will be higher for those who receive the compression belt in addition to       the lumbopelvic stabilization program as compared to those who receive the lumbopelvic       stabilization alone. Data Analysis: Two separate ANOVAs group x time with repeated       measures will be used to examine the effect of the interventions on disability and the       percent change of muscle thickness. Whitney U-test will be used to analyze the NPRS data,       and descriptive statistics will be used to report the GROC scores. Clinical Relevance: The       results of the study may provide evidence in prescribing pelvic compression belt for those       with SIJ pain. It will also offer guidance as to how and when pelvic compression belts       should be used in this population. Finally, it will guide physical therapists in prescribing       effective interventions for those with SIJ pain.

This may lead to an       increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose of glaucoma management is to       lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic neuropathy and subsequent visual       loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering drug therapy. However, if IOP       remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP,       surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy with a collagen implant DSCI is a       non-penetrating surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the       enhancement of the aqueous outflow.

Up to date the suggested treatments for CIAKI are partially       effective and have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration yet. The lack of       effective nephroprotective drug for CIAKI, emphasizes the need not only for additional new       drugs but also for new strategies that might also clarify CIAKI pathophysiology. To the best       of our knowledge, the potentially beneficial effect of carnitine and PDE5 inhibitors on       CIAKI prevention has not been examined, so far. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Hypothesis 1: More studies are focusing now on strategies to preserve tissue mitochondria       and subsequently to maintain normal organ functioning [62]. One of these strategies is the       use of Carnitine. Carnitine was first described in the early beginnings of the 20th century.       In humans, 75% of carnitine is obtained from diet [63], whereas the rest is synthesized from       two essential amino acids, lysine and methionine in kidney, liver and brain [64]. Carnitine       transports long-chain acyl groups from fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, so they       can be broken down through β-oxidation to acytl-coenzyme-A to obtain energy balance across       cell membranes of tissues that derive much of their energy from fatty acid oxidation such as       cardiac and skeletal muscles [66,67].        Plasma concentration of free carnitine is in dynamic balance with acylcarnitines with the       acyl to free carnitine ratio of ≤ 0.4 being considered normal [65], however, in uremic       patients, this balance is disrupted, and this ratio is altered because of a larger amount of       free carnitine is esterified to acyl-carnitine to buffer the excess of acyl groups,       modulating the bound CoA to free CoA [68]. This may cause several metabolic disturbances at       the cellular level, including impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and energy       production, accumulation of toxic acyl moieties, and inhibition of key enzymes of metabolic       pathway [69]. These metabolic abnormalities may lead to the several clinical alterations       often observed in these patients, such as muscle weakness and myopathy, loss of body protein       and cachexia, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, plasma lipid abnormalities, anemia       refractory to erythropoietin EPO treatment, cardiomyopathy, and intradialytic symptoms       [70,71,72]. Thus, the imbalanced in acyl/free carnitine ratio may explain the higher risk of       patients with chronic renal failure to CIAKI. However, Carnitine supplementation may       contribute to the regeneration of sequestrated free CoA and to maintain normal metabolic       processes [66,67].        Experimental studies shows that L-propionylcarnitine, a propionyl ester of L-carnitine, was       able to prevent cyclosporine immunosuppressive agent following organ transplantation       induced acute nephrotoxicity, reducing lipid peroxidation and significantly lowering blood       pressure. L-propionylcarnitine prevented the decline in creatinine clearance in cyclosporine       chronically treated animals [73]. Patients treated with carnitine displayed improved       physical performance and treatment-related chronic fatigue, cardiovascular disease, cancer,       diabetes, and other chronic syndromes, caused by impaired carnitine production in kidney       disease [36-38]. In the last decade there are increasing reports describing the beneficial       use of carnitine for a better energy metabolism mitochondrial metabolism. Carnitine       increases albumin and protein levels, restores antioxidant defenses, and improves       nutritional status, cardiac, vascular smooth muscle, and muscular function [39-42]. The       postulated beneficial effect of carnitine treatment is by directing lipids towards oxidation       and ATP production. Another possible protective effect of carnitine on contrast media       induced lesions is its ability to suppress the development of oxidative stress and free       radical generation [74]. Free radicals, and in particular hydroxyl radical, lead to lipid       peroxidation of cell membranes, causing degradation of phospholipids, resulting in increased       production of renal vasoconstrictors [75].        It should be emphasized that carnitine is available as a medication and is approved by the       FDA for treating secondary deficiency due to metabolic diseases. Intravenous administration       of carnitine is safe, and its pharmacokinetics can be analyzed just by knowing the pre-dose       level in plasma [76]. Further, after single-dose intravenous administration of 0.5 g of       acetyl-L-carnitine, its rapidly, but not completely hydrolyzed, and acetyl-L-carnitine and       L-carnitine concentrations return to baseline within 12 hours. Even in high doses;       intravenous doses as high as 300 mg/kg have been administered with no apparent toxicity.       However, the most commonly reported adverse effects are few and nonserious including       gastritis, diarrhea, and body odor.        The beneficial carnitine supplies have been extensively evaluated in animals and humans       during the last 20 years. As a result, several experts have already aimed to revise the       clinical evidence supporting its therapeutic use. In Addition to the light of the growing       experimental evidences for the beneficial effects of carnitine as an antioxidant and as a       beneficial modulator of mitochondrial energy expenditure, it is tempting to explore the       possibility that carnitine may exert nephroprotective effects in CIAKI.        Hypothesis 2: Another new upraising strategy that has been used in attenuating renal injury       in experimental studies is the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 PDE5 inhibitor agents [77,       78]. PDE5 inhibitors are approved by the FDA for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary       hypertension. The latter have been found to exert a significant antiapoptotic effect on       renal tubular cells exposed to partial unilateral ureteral obstruction [79]. Part of the       physiological process of PDE5 inhibition involves the release of nitric oxide NO. Brando       et al. linked the increase in available pool of cyclic 3,5 guanosine monophosphate cGMP by       phosphodiesterases inhibitors to prevention and ameliorating chronic renal damage mainly by       attenuating hypertension and retarding progression of renal disease [80]. Furthermore a PDE       5 inhibitor has been demonstrated to be able to ameliorate nephrotoxicity. Noami H. et al.       have shown that FR226807, a selective PDE5 inhibitor, ameliorates cyclosporine A       nephrotoxicity with further increases in cGMP content [81]. These observations may be of       relevance for contrast media induced renal injury and suggest PDE5 inhibition as a potential       therapeutic approach to this clinical entity.        In sum, CIAKI is a common iatrogenic. Up to date the suggested treatments for CIAKI are       partially effective and have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration yet. The       lack of effective nephroprotective drug for CIAKI, emphasizes the need not only for       additional new drugs but also for new strategies that might also clarify CIAKI       pathophysiology. To the best of our knowledge, the potentially beneficial effect of       carnitine and PDE5 inhibitors on CIAKI prevention has not been examined, so far.

S-100B is localized in astroglia. This marker is used to predict       neuronal damage caused by traumatic brain injury. The investigators conduct a study to       derive and validate the measurement of S-100B in serum of patients with different types       traumatic brain injuries. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The neuromarker S-100B is a well established tool for decision making in patients traumatic       brain injury TBIin Europe. In many hospitals S-100B is used routinely as a part of a set       of high- and medium risk factors aiding the decision to perform a cranial computed       tomography CCT in patients with minor head injury MHI. In patients with severe head       injury Raabe et al. found a significant correlation between the S-100B levels and       unfavourable outcome in patients with severe brain injury with serum levels higher than 0.50       μg/l measured 24h after injury. The average level of the neuromarker, compared with other       studies. The study of Biberthaler et al. showed highest levels in patients with epidural       hematomas, followed by subdural, subarachnoidal and intracerebral hematomas.

As part       of the study protocol, inhaled Capsaicin solutions were analyzed using high performance       liquid chromatography HPLC. The investigation employed safety procedures while conducting       the human inhalation investigations. In addition, during our investigations we observed       discrepancies between the predicted Capsaicin concentrations mixed by a registered       pharmacist and the actual capsaicin concentrations determined by HPLC. The stability of       Capsaicin solutions stored over a seven month period and refrigerated at 4degrees C and       protected against ultraviolet light were examined. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       After a research subjects death during an inhalation study using medications/drugs not       approved for this route, the FDA prohibited human use of non-approved chemicals including       capsaicin administered via inhalation.        Capsaicin inhalation challenge tests CICT were performed on forty men of different ages       utilizing pharmaceutical grade Capsaicin. Solutions were mixed by a registered pharmacist       and Capsaicin doses, administered to subjects, were analyzed by high performance liquid       chromatography HPLC. Capsaicin solutions were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C and       shielded from ultraviolet light for 7 months. There was serial monitoring by spirometry and       impulse oscillometry, electrocardiography, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation       measurements.        There were no adverse reactions at any dose, including the highest capsaicin concentration.       Serial spirometry and impulse oscillometry, electrocardiography, blood pressure, pulse and       oxygen saturation measurements did not change. The actual amount of pharmaceutical-grade       capsaicin measured was 85.5% of the concentrations estimated by the registered pharmacist at       time of mixing. The difference was more for the lowest 0.49 uMol dose 28.1 compared to a       2.2% lesser concentration for the 1000 uMol solution. Capsaicin concentrations fell after 3       months of storage.        Dilute capsaicin aerosol inhalation is relatively innocuous and CICT is safe. The actual       amount of pharmaceutical-grade capsaicin inhaled by subjects is less than the estimate at       mixing. Capsaicin loses potency after 3-months of protected storage. Inhalation studies       involving non-approved drugs or chemicals/medications can be safely conducted when they       follow the appropriate safety procedures such as described in this investigation.

These       hematomas develop after minor head trauma and increase in size over weeks. Patients usually       present with headaches, gait disturbances, language problems or confusion. The state of the       art treatment of a symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma is to remove the hematoma by burr       hole trepanation.        The optimal follow-up for operated patients remains controversial. Due to the known high       rate of a second hematoma at the same place usually within weeks, one strategy is to       perform serial computer tomography scans in order to identify recurrent hematomas early. The       radiologic evidence of a second hematoma often leads to reoperation, even if the patient has       no, or just slight symptoms. Another strategy after surgical hematoma evacuation is to       closely follow the patient with neurological examinations and perform neuroimaging only in       case of new symptoms. Advocators of this strategy argue that a follow-up with routine CT       scans may be harmful due to additional and maybe unnecessary surgeries and hospital days in       a patient population marked by advanced age and fragility.        The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of computer tomography scanning in the       postoperative follow-up after removal of a chronic subdural hematoma. Participants of this       study will be allocated by chance to one of two study groups: Patients allocated to group A       will receive a computer tomography scan on day 2 and again on day 30 after surgery in       addition to a clinical examination. Patients allocated to group B will be examined       clinically on day 2 and day 30 without computer tomography. All patients will undergo a       final clinical examination after 6 months. The study will recruit 400 patients. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background        Chronic subdural hematoma CSH is one of the most common intracranial bleedings in patients       over 60 years of age and a frequently found neurosurgical entity. Age related brain atrophy       leads to enlargement of the subarachnoid space, a space limited by the dura mater and the       arachnoid membrane. Blood vessels that occupy this space are being stretched and may rupture       after a minor head trauma. Although the resulting bleeding itself is often without       noticeable consequence for the patient, the anatomical outcome may be serious as it enlarges       the subdural space. The formation of new leaky capillary-like vessels and/or volume       enhancing osmotic gradients lead to the enlargement of the subdural hematoma over weeks,       filling the intracranial space and compressing the brain. Headaches, gait disturbances,       language problems, hemiparesis and decreased consciousness are among the many presenting       symptoms and tend to develop over days or weeks.        Computed tomography CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head typically       reveals the blood accumulation in the subdural space. Standard treatment includes the       evacuation of the subdural blood through burr holes see below under either local or       general anesthesia. In cases when a hematoma clot cannot be evacuated through burr holes a       small craniotomy is performed. CSH is feared for its high recurrence rate between 9 and       27% that mostly occurs within 3 months of the initial operation.        The optimal follow-up course for operated patients remains controversial. Due to the high       rate of recurrences, one strategy is to perform serial CT scans in order to identify       recurrent hematomas early. The radiologic evidence of a recurrent or significant persistent       hematoma often leads to reoperation. Another strategy after surgical hematoma evacuation is       to closely follow the patient with neurological examinations and perform neuroimaging only       in case of persistent or new neurologic deficits. Advocators of this strategy argue that       follow up with routine CT scans may be harmful due to additional and maybe unnecessary       surgeries and hospital days in a patient population marked by advanced age and fragility.        However, even when neuroimaging is done routinely, no correlation has been observed between       the radiologic evidence of a hematoma remnant and the reoperation rate. This observation has       been reported by Mori and Maeda in a retrospective analysis of 500 patients. Some persistent       hematoma is almost always seen after the surgical intervention and there seems to be a       correlation between the re-expansion rate of the brain and the likelihood of hematoma       recurrence. However, the correlation is weak and of little practical value for patient       treatment. The high incidence of hematoma remnants in post-op imaging complicates the       indication for re-operation of a recurrent CSH solely by imaging criteria. Since the       presence and the amount of remnant hematoma after the operation is a poor predictor of       future recurrent hematoma some clinicians refrain from postoperative CT scans and rely       solely on neurological assessments. If patients become symptomatic, serial CT scans are       performed and surgery is scheduled in cases of persistent, enlarging or new hematoma. The       discrepancy in follow-up strategy reflects our current incomplete understanding of the       pathophysiology of CSH and its recurrence.        The aim of the current study is to evaluate the role of CT scanning in the postoperative       treatment course after neurosurgical evacuation of CSH in a prospective, randomized       controlled trial.        Objective        The hypothesis of interest to test in this trial is that a follow-up protocol without any CT       scan is not inferior to a follow-up protocol with serial CT scans after neurosurgical       evacuation of CSH as assessed with the modified Rankin scale at 6 months. Additional       hypotheses of interest are that the size/volume/features of the hematoma rest/remnant in an       early <72 hours CT scan after neurosurgical evacuation is not correlated to the       neurological status of the patient and that the size/volume/features of the hematoma       rest/remnant on post-op CT scans is not predictive for reoperation.        Methods        Patients will be screened and included into this study within 48 hours after surgery for a       chronic subdural hematoma burr hole trepanation and insertion of drainage. Study patients       are randomized 1:1 on day 2 after surgery into CT-Scan arm group A or Clinical arm       group B. A CT scan is scheduled for patients of group A on day 2 and 30 after surgery.       Patients of both study groups A and B will receive a neurological follow-up examination at       day 2, 30 days and 6 months after surgery. Regardless of randomization all patients will       receive CT scanning if judged necessary on clinical grounds at any time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       INTRODUCTION:        Globally there have been about 45,000 kidney transplants last year. Currently, the overall       survival of renal transplant receptors is 95% in the first year and 85% at 5 years. A major       challenge to overcome by the renal transplant surgeons, are surgical complications which may       impact on patient morbidity and mortality, as well as graft function.        Since 2000 to date the specialties Hospital from the Western Medical Center of the Mexican       Institute of Social Security, is the hospital where the greatest number of kidney       transplants are performed, reporting to December 2005 a total of 990 cases, with an average       of 200 transplants annually.        Since the completion of the first kidney transplants, there has emerged the presence of       complications related to the surgical procedure, which have influenced the morbidity and       mortality in transplant patients. Several factors are attributed to the occurrence of       postoperative complications, such as the patients nutritional status, ischemic time,       presence of comorbidities, organ preservation, surgical technique, experience and skills of       the surgeon and the postoperative care.        The main causes of complications in the kidney transplants are: urological complications       such as urinary fistula, ureteral obstruction and ureteral necrosis less than 7% of all       kidney transplants. Ischemia is the most common probable cause of urological complications       secondary to donor kidney extraction, anastomotic technique, variations in vascular supply,       rejection or medication. Vascular complications as early arterial thrombosis, renal vein       thrombosis and renal artery stenosis, are almost always due to a technical complication, or       are accompanied by twisting or bending of blood vessels during placement of the transplanted       kidney. Technical difficulties may be secondary to atherosclerotic disease in the donor or       receptor, or interact with multiple arteries. Lymphatic complications as lymphocele and       lymphatic fistula, after renal transplantation accumulation of lymphatic fluid       postoperatively are up to 15% of the patients. It is believed that the origin of the lymph       is in the destruction of perivascular normal lymph ducts during dissection, or destruction       of the hilar lymph.        Decreasing the incidence of surgical wound infection after renal transplantation is       multifactorial and is related to advances in the treatment of anemia, uremia, and general       health of patients with end-stage renal disease.        The seals are partly fibrin blood products and pharmacological agents. Their specific use is       as an adjunct to hemostasis as tissue adhesive. Seals are also developed as fibrin vehicle       to provide antimicrobial pharmacological agents, chemotherapeutic agents and growth factors.        They have the advantage of being products of human origin without tissue toxicity, which       promotes rapid fibrin seal. The seal is normally reabsorbed in days, promoting local tissue       growth and repair without increasing perioperative development of adhesions.        OBJECTIVE:        Assess whether application of fibrin seal prevents postoperative complications in patients       undergoing kidney transplantation.        MATERIAL AND METHODS:        Controlled clinical trial with single-blind evaluation in patients surgically intervened       kidney transplantation. It will include all patients undergoing renal transplantation in       this Medical Center, any gender and over than 16 years and under 60 years. Patients will be       excluded with allergy to the fibrin glue components. All the transplant procedure will be       made for the same surgical team.        The receptor site preparation will be done by addressing the retroperitoneal region of the       right lower quadrant of the abdomen with an incision Gibson type.        The patients are going to be distributed into two groups: Group 1: fibrin, Group 2: Control.       Complication weather vascular, urological, lymphatic, infectious, hospital stay and graft       loss will be assessed.        The receptor site preparation will be done by addressing the retroperitoneal region of the       right lower quadrant of the abdomen with an incision Gibson type.        The dissection of great vessels will be performed to achieve hemostasis of the blood vessels       and nodes, with electrocoagulation and ligation gauge nonabsorbable 3-0.        The vascular anastomosis will be made to the external iliac vessels of the receptor in       shaped end-side way, the suture material in size 6-0, in continuous sutures type with       nonabsorbable monofilament. The new ureteral anastomosis will be performed with the modified       technique of Leriche-Gregoire.        The new ureter will be tunneled and anastomosed to the mucosa with absorbable suture       material 4-0 polyglactin. The biological adhesive will be applied to the study group, with       the spray technique in two atmospheres of pressure in a total amount of 10 ml. No biological       adhesive, placebo or simulated technique will be performed to the control group.        There will be placed a continuous suction drainage of closed silicone type, and the       abdominal wall will be closed with absorbable material in both groups.        Patients will be followed from the immediate postoperative period until discharge, and at       follow up every week the first month, then every 15 days the second month, and monthly until       one year follow up. During this follow-up, patients will be assessed through laboratory       tests that include complete blood count, blood chemistry with serial measurements of serum       creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, serum electrolytes and blood levels of       immunosuppressants. Also patients will be followed from the clinical point of view and if       there is any suspect for a complication, laboratory exams will be conducted such as crops,       urinalysis, determination of creatinine, noninvasive imaging studies such as Doppler       ultrasound, computed tomography, angiography if suspect on vascular complications.

It is a leading candidate vaccination strategy against malaria. In       the field, Phase I studies have been conducted in adults in Kenya and The Gambia and       children and infants in The Gambia. The vaccination strategy appears safe and well tolerated       in these populations, and also shows impressive immunogenicity, not significantly different       to that seen in the UK trials where efficacy was shown. In particular, recent data from The       Gambia shows excellent safety and immunogenicity in infants in malaria endemic areas, who       would be the ones to benefit most from such a vaccine against malaria. With this clinical       development as background, the investigators now propose to evaluate efficacy against       natural malaria infection in this important target group for an effective malaria vaccine,       that is, 5-17 month infants and children living in malaria endemic areas.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Inappropriate sinus tachycardia IST is a non-paroxysmal arrhythmia, characterized by a       persistently high sinus heart rate HR and/or an exaggerated HR response to minimal       exertion, and can be responsible for palpitations, asthenia, chest pain, dizziness and       syncope, which can be highly invalidating. Conventional treatment of IST, targeted to       symptoms control, mainly consists on β-blockers. However, these drugs are often insufficient       or not well tolerated because of side effects mostly hypotension that usually limit the       administered dose. Ivabradine, a sinus rate lowering agent currently employed in Europe in       the treatment of stable angina and chronic heart failure, has recently been demonstrated to       be effective and safe in the treatment of IST by a few case reports and clinical trials.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01660594","TITLE:       CT Calcium Scoring in Suspected Stable Angina SUMMARY:       Patients with stable chest pain presenting to general practitioners in UK are routinely       referred to the chest pain clinics in the hospitals. They are assessed by clinical history       including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. CT       calcium scoring CTCS is a technique that is very sensitive in identifying and quantifying       calcified atherosclerotic plaques. Recent guidance from the National Institute of Clinical       Excellence NICE, citation 1 proposes the use of CTCS in patients with stable chest pain       who have low likelihood of coronary artery disease CAD. They recommend that patients with       low likelihood 10-30% have a CTCS and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have       non-cardiac chest pain. However, there is controversy regarding relationship of absent       calcification with significant CAD and its prognostic value.        At our institution, we have been performing CTCS in this patient cohort since 2003. We plan       to retrospectively review the usefulness in CTCS in patients with different likelihood for       significant CAD, particularly in patients with absent calcium and compare with the       traditional assessment. We also plan to follow-up these patients for any myocardial       infarction and death from any cause. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The study seeks to determine the usefulness of CT calcium scoring CTCS in patients       presenting with non-acute chest pain to the rapid access chest pain clinic RACPC and       compare it with the traditional assessment in predicting significant CAD and outcome with       respect to non-fatal MI or death. The clinical, diagnostic, and follow-up data of patients       in last 7 years since CTCS has been performed in the hospital would be retrospectively       analysed for the purpose.        Background Patients with chest pain excluding that of sudden onset are routinely referred       by the GPs to the RACPC centres in the hospitals. They are assessed by clinical history       including risk factors, cardiovascular exam, resting ECG, chest x-ray, and exercise ECG. At       our institution, we have also been performing CTCS in men more than 40 and women more than       50 years of age since 2003. Recent NICE guidance1 recommends that patients with low pre-test       probability 10-30% of significant coronary artery disease CAD have a CT calcium scoring       scan and if the score is 0, they can be considered to have non-cardiac chest pain. However,       there is controversy regarding relationship of absent calcification with significant CAD and       its prognostic value.        This study would enable us to compare and determine the value of CTCS in patients with       non-acute chest pain in predicting significant CAD and safety of absent coronary artery       calcification.        Rationale for Study          1. To determine if CT coronary calcium scoring adds any value to the existing clinical            assessment and exercise ECG. This is not well established in patients presenting with            non-acute chest pain to the rapid access chest pain clinics.          2. The study would help in determining if absence of calcification on CT can be considered            to have low likelihood of significant coronary artery disease and a good cardiovascular            outcome over the period of follow-up. Both these issues are currently controversial in            the literature in this group of patients.        STUDY OBJECTIVES        Primary Objective To determine the prognostic value of CT coronary calcium scoring in       patients with non-acute chest pain for non-fatal MI and death, and compare with traditional       assessment including exercise ECG.        Secondary Objectives To determine how CT coronary calcium scoring compare with traditional       assessment including exercise ECG in predicting significant coronary artery disease in       patients presenting with non-acute chest pain.        METHODOLOGY Design This is a retrospective cross-sectional study involving analysis of       patients clinical, diagnostic, and management data from hospital records and follow-up       questionnaires for outcome. The study does not require any new diagnostic, therapeutic, or       interventional procedure.        Data of patients who have presented to the chest pain clinic since October 2003 would be       collected from hospital records for:          1. Age, sex, type of chest pain, and risk factors. These would be used to calculate the            pre-test probability of significant coronary artery disease CAD using Dukes score.          2. Results of exercise ECG where performed.          3. Results of CT calcium scoring.          4. Results of other non-invasive investigations such as stress imaging and CT coronary            angiography where performed.          5. Results of invasive coronary angiography where performed. Patients with >70% diameter            stenosis or those who underwent percutaneous stent insertion PCI or bypass surgery            would be considered to have significant CAD.        For those patients who do not undergo any PCI or surgery as a result of above evaluation, we       will try to find out if they have subsequently suffered any heart attack or died. This would       again be performed through hospital records and if not available, through questionnaires       send to the patients and/or their GPs as part of standard clinical care.

By using an individuals risk       assessment to determining testing, we hope to improve the quality and efficiency of the care       delivered to Emergency Department patients with chest pain. Our study will determine if the       HEART pathway, which combines a clinical decision rule, the HEART score, and two serial       troponin measurements, will reduce stress testing and cardiovascular imaging, decrease       hospital length of stay, and reduce cost compared to usual care, while maintaining safety. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Approximately 8-10 million patients complaining of chest pain present to an Emergency       Department ED annually in the United States. The total cost of chest pain evaluations has       been estimated at $5-10 billion annually, yet only 10% of these patients are ultimately       diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome. American College of Cardiology/ American Heart       Association ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that patients at low-risk for acute coronary       syndrome should receive serial cardiac markers followed by objective cardiac testing stress       testing or cardiac imaging. However, many have questioned the value of objective cardiac       testing in all low-risk patients.Cardiac testing for all patients at low-risk for acute       coronary syndrome ACS is not sustainable from a healthcare quality or economic       perspective. In addition to increasing costs, objective cardiac testing is associated with a       substantial number of false positive and non-diagnostic tests, which lead to additional       unnecessary and often invasive procedures.        Implementation of accurate risk stratification care pathways designed to eliminate       unnecessary cardiac testing could improve the efficiency and quality of care by decreasing       false positive/non-diagnostic testing, radiation, and costs. The HEART pathway, which       combines a clinical decision rule, the HEART score, and two serial troponin measurements, is       a recently developed care pathway designed to identify chest pain patients for early       discharge without objective testing.        Primary Hypothesis: The HEART Pathway, when compared to usual care, will reduce 30 day       objective cardiac testing, hospital length of stay, and cost, while maintaining patient       safety.        Methods: Participants n=282 at risk for ACS will be recruited into a clinical trial from       Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center WFBMC ED. Patients will be equally randomized to HEART       Pathway or Usual Care. HEART Pathway participants treating physician will follow HEART       Pathway guidelines for identifying patients to be admitted to the hospital or observation       unit for cardiac testing or to be discharged home without testing. Usual Care participants       treating physicians will decide whether the patients should be discharged home or admitted       to the hospital or observation unit based on ACC/AHA guidelines without using the HEART       pathway.

Patients are stratified according to risk level       node-negative and recurrence score [RS] > 25 in the primary tumor, and a tumor measuring ≥       2 cm in greatest diameter treated with adjuvant therapy vs 1-3 positive lymph nodes and RS >       25 treated with adjuvant therapy vs ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes [any RS value] treated with       adjuvant therapy vs ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes [any RS value] prior to or after neoadjuvant       chemotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.          -  Arm I: Patients receive an approved endocrine therapy comprising tamoxifen citrate*,            goserelin acetate** or leuprolide acetate**, or aromatase inhibitor anastrozole,            letrozole, or exemestane for 2-5 years. Patients also receive a placebo orally PO            daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.          -  Arm II: Patients receive an approved endocrine therapy regimen as in arm I. Patients            also receive everolimus PO daily for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or            unacceptable toxicity.        NOTE: *Men receive tamoxifen citrate PO for 5 years.        NOTE: **Goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate is given if patient is or becomes       postmenopausal.        Blood and tissue samples are collected for biomarker studies.

The patient data from the electronic medical       records and existing database will be collected and analyzed. Primary endpoints will be       postoperative mortality within 30 days and overall complications and length of hospital       stay. The secondary endpoints will be myocardial infarction, cardiac death, CHF, arrhythmia,       ischemia, stroke, neurological complications, length of ICU stay, re-admission rate,       infections, pulmonary complications, length of intubation time, length of ventilation time,       and acute renal failure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Each year about 694,000 Americans have open-heart surgery including valve repairs, valve       replacements, heart transplants, and coronary artery bypass graft CABG surgery [1]. The       reported incidence of perioperative complications in these cardiac surgery patients is 4.5%       while the prevalence varied from1.6% to 14.1% [2,3]. As the population ages, increased       numbers of elderly patients with more advanced cardiac diseases and comorbidities are being       referred for cardiac surgery. For these patients, postoperative cardiovascular complications       cardiac death, myocardial infarction MI, ischemia, congestive heart failure CHF,       arrhythmia, stroke, and acute renal failure ARF represent the major postoperative       complications [4-6]. These complications translate into increased mortality, prolonged       hospital stay and estimated costs exceeding $20 billion annually [7].        These events may be triggered by surgical stress responses that result in increased plasma       levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine [8], myocardial oxygen supply demand imbalance, and       plaque rupture [9].        Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, alfa2-agonists, Aspirin, statins, nitrates, anti-platelet       medications and anticoagulation medications have been widely used in patients with coronary       artery disease, hypertension and other heart diseases. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and       Aspirin statins have also been shown to have a positive impact on the outcomes of surgical       and non-surgical treatments [10-11]. However, there are other studies which were unable to       demonstrate the positive results of these medications on post-operative outcomes.        Based on the previous studies referenced above, we propose that the use of perioperative       medications Betablockers, ACE inhibitors, alfa2-agonists, Aspirin, statins, nitrates,       anti-platelet medications, and anticoagulation medications may provide cardiac protection       for cardiac surgical patients. The specific aim of this study is to retrospectively       investigate whether perioperative medication use is associated with decreases in the       incidence of postoperative cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing elective       cardiac surgery.        This study will be a retrospective study. The patient data from the electronic medical       records and existing database will be collected and analyzed. Primary endpoints will be       postoperative mortality within 30 days and overall complications and length of hospital       stay. The secondary endpoints will be myocardial infarction, cardiac death, CHF, arrhythmia,       ischemia, stroke, neurological complications, length of ICU stay, re-admission rate,       infections, pulmonary complications, length of intubation time, length of ventilation time,       and acute renal failure.

In people with spinal cord injury,       some fibers may be destroyed at the site of injury, while others remain connected but do not       work correctly to carry electrical impulses. As a result, subjects with an incomplete spinal       cord injury may have spasticity which is muscle spasms or muscle stiffness that makes       movement difficult. Fampridine-SR is an experimental drug that increases the ability of the       nerve to conduct electrical impulses. This study will examine the effects of Fampridine-SR       on moderate to severe lower-limb spasticity, as well as the effects on bodily functions such       as bladder control, bowel function and sexual function.

While a high       percentage of women quit smoking during pregnancy, the majority relapse in the first 6       months postpartum. We propose developing and pilot testing a phone-based postpartum       continuing care PPCC protocol based on existing evidence-based approaches to increase       smoking cessation, reduce relapse, increase early re-intervention, and reduce infant       exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the postpartum period. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The large majority of women who quit smoking during pregnancy relapse in the first six       months postpartum, highlighting a need for effective postpartum continuing care that       supports women through the challenging postpartum period when stress is high and motivation       to stay quit may decline. Existing relapse prevention interventions typically delivered       during pregnancy have been found to be of little benefit during the postpartum period,       suggesting the need for a more formal continuing care approach. Phone-based protocols for       smoking cessation have been widely disseminated and effective because they address the need       for flexible access, but are passive and not typically utilized by women in the postpartum       period.        The proposed pilot study will develop and test a Phone-based Postpartum Continuing Care       PPCC model that draws from existing evidence-based protocols--the 5 As and Recovery       Management Checkups RMC-- shown to be effective with other populations. The experimental       PPCC will reinforce the importance of abstinence, relapse prevention, and reduced smoking       through proactive re-intervention i.e., RMC with the 5 As at times when postpartum women       are more likely to relapse, and provide education and monitoring of the infants direct and       indirect exposure to nicotine through breastfeeding and secondhand smoke. We will evaluate       PPCCs effectiveness relative to a passive referral to a 24/7 hotline, which is current       standard care.        Approximately one hundred thirty women in their first or second trimester of pregnancy who       were nicotine-dependent in the past year, currently smoke, or quit within the past 90 days       will be recruited at their first prenatal appointment at the Maryland Womens Center MWC       in Baltimore, Maryland. All women will receive the clinics standard of care for smoking       cessation--the 5 As --during pregnancy from their physician. Half will be randomly assigned       to an experimental group getting PPCC for 6 months postpartum and half to a control group       receiving only a referral to a passive 24/7 state quit line postpartum. It is expected that       in the 6 months following childbirth women in the experimental PPCC relative to those in       the control group will: a smoke fewer cigarettes, b smoke fewer days, c go longer before       postpartum relapse, d have less time between relapse and talking to a health professional       about smoking, e have less time between relapse and resumption of abstinence , f smoke       fewer times while breastfeeding, g smoke fewer times while in the same room as the infant,       and h reduce their infants cotinine levels.        The aims of this pilot project are to develop PPCC from existing evidence-based approaches,       demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the PPCC intervention with at least 80%       compliance and at least 80% follow-up at each wave, and evaluate the effect size associated       with receiving standard care vs. standard care + PPCC in order to understand the promise of       and appropriate power required for a larger clinical trial.

The investigators       research questions are: Will a structured nutrition and exercise program in pregnancy       compared to usual prenatal care increase the chance that mothers will achieve pregnancy       weight gain within the current recommendations; improve health measures, in mother and       infant at six months post-partum; to evaluate the benefits of a high dairy intake in       pregnancy on maintenance of bone status in the mother and bone health outcomes in the child       in early life 6 months; and to investigate the interactions between genes associated with       bone health and high dairy diet supplementation on bone status in mothers during pregnancy,       and bone health in mothers post-delivery and children to 6 months of age. Mothers weight,       physical activity and adherence to the nutrition plan will be assessed until birth and at       follow-up with their infants at 6 months after birth. The research team will ensure new       information is quickly transferred to programs to assist women to have healthier       pregnancies. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This will be a 2-arm randomized 3-site trial. Recruitment will be within the community care       clinics by poster and flyer advertisements. Pregnant women will be stratified by BMI       categories and study site and randomized within strata to Group A Nutrition+Exercise       intervention program or Group B Usual Prenatal Care + Health Canada materials about       healthy pregnancy + two focus group sessions exploring womens experiences with exercise,       nutrition and weight gain in pregnancy.        Primary research question: Among pregnant women, does introducing a structured and monitored       nutrition and exercise program treatment in early pregnancy compared with Usual Prenatal       Care control increase the likelihood of attaining gestational weight gain within the       Institute of Medicine IOM guidelines over the pregnancy period? Secondary research       questions: Among pregnant women population, does introducing a structured and monitored       nutrition and exercise program in early pregnancy intervention compared with Standard       Prenatal Care control lead to 1 better maternal outcomes outcome at 6 months post-       partum; and ii better infant outcomes outcome at 6 months post partum?; and 2 i to       evaluate the benefits of a high dairy intake in pregnancy on maintenance of bone status in       the mother and bone health outcomes in the child in early life 6 months; and ii to       investigate the interactions between genes associated with bone health and high dairy diet       supplementation on bone status in mothers during pregnancy, and bone health in mothers       post-delivery and children to 6 months of age.        Experimental and Control groups: Both groups of mothers and their health care providers will       be given the Health Canada materials on Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy, Eating Well       with Canadas Food Guide and the Pregnancy Weight Gain Calculator. Baseline information       will be recorded for eligible and consenting women after which they will be randomized to       Experimental or Control group. Nutrition intake, physical measures and physical activity       will be recorded at baseline, 26-28 weeks, 36-38 weeks of gestation, and 6 months postpartum       in the same manner for both groups. All mothers will receive the study promotional materials       and small incentives. Also, all mothers will be followed by their primary care provider and       have usual access to public health.

Patients with these problems are a       high-risk surgical group as they have generalized blood vessel disease. These puts them at       risk of major complications around the time of surgery such as heart attacks , strokes and       death. The mortality following repair of a swollen main artery in the abdomen is about 1 in       20. This contrasts poorly with the 1 per 100 risk of death following a heart bypass. Simple       and cost-effective methods are needed to reduce the risks of major vascular surgery. Remote       ischaemic preconditioning RIPC may be such a technique. To induce RIPC, the blood supply       to muscle in the patients arm is interrupted for about 5 minutes. It is then restored for a       further five minutes. This cycle is repeated three more times. The blood supply is       interrupted simply by inflating a blood pressure cuff to maximum pressure. This repeated       brief interruption of the muscular blood supply sends signals to critical organs such as the       brain and heart, which are rendered temporarily resistant to damage from reduced blood       supply. Several small randomized clinical trials in patients undergoing different types of       major vascular surgery have demonstrated a potential benefit. This large, multi-centre trial       aims to determine whether RIPC can reduce complications in routine practice. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The demand for major vascular surgery is increasing [1]. Patients requiring procedures such       as aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, lower limb surgical re-vascularisation       and major lower limb amputation for end-stage vascular disease constitute a high-risk       surgical cohort. Peri-operative complications such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular       accident, renal failure and death are common [2,3]. Multiple potential mechanisms may result       in these complications. For example, myocardial injury may result from systemic hypotension       leading to reduced flow across a tight coronary artery stenosis or, alternatively, it may       arise due to acute occlusion when an unstable plaque ruptures. Most strategies aimed at       peri-operative risk reduction target a single potential mechanism. For example,       beta-blockade may prevent myocardial injury due to overwork, but cannot prevent acute       coronary occlusion. There is a requirement for a simple, effective intervention that       protects tissues against injury via multiple different mechanisms. Remote ischemic       preconditioning RIPC may be suitable.        Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon whereby a brief period of non-lethal ischemia in a       tissue renders it resistant to the effects of a subsequent much longer ischaemic insult. It       was first described in the canine heart [4]. Subsequent clinical trials showed that ischemic       preconditioning reduced heart muscle damage following coronary artery bypass grafting [5]       and liver dysfunction following hepatic resection [6]. Following cardiac surgery, it is       associated with a reduction in critical care stay, arrhythmias and inotrope use [7].       However, ischemic preconditioning requires direct interference with the target tissues       blood supply, limiting its clinical utility. Further experimental work suggested that brief       ischemia in one tissue, such as the kidneys, could confer protection on distant organs such       as the heart [8]. A similar effect was observed after transient skeletal muscle ischemia       [9-11]. This effect is referred to as preconditioning at a distance or remote ischemic       preconditioning RIPC.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       In western countries 80 % of patients with ischemic heart disease IHD are overweight BMI       > 25. Weight loss using a low energy diet LED, 800 - 1000 kcal/day has been shown to       induce a considerable weight loss in obese but otherwise healthy patients and to reduce the       risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in these subjects. Additionally, a British study       using a very low energy diet VLED, 600 kcal/day to obtain weight loss, has shown that       subject with diagnosed type 2 diabetes had their blood glucose normalized after an 8 week       VLED. However, the effect of LED has never been examined in overweight patients with IHD.        Several studies have shown that patients with IHD have a beneficial effect of exercise       training regarding mortality and reduction in cardiovascular risk factors. A Norwegian group       has shown that aerobic interval training results in the biggest increase in maximal oxygen       uptake VO2max. A high VO2max is correlated to decreased mortality in patients with IHD.        In conclusion, weight loss and exercise are known strategies in preventing progression of       IHD and development of type 2 diabetes in these patients, however a head-to-head comparison       of the two methods has never been made and it is unknown which intervention is the most       effective in improving cardiovascular risk profile.

More information on the changes associated with both benign and       cancerous breast lesions will help develop better risk information. Researchers have been       looking at cells found in breast milk to study genetic changes related to breast cancer.       However, most of these cell samples have been collected from white women. A new study wants       to collect breast milk samples from African American women for further research. Comparing       the results of genetic tests will help improve understanding of breast cancer risk in all       women.        Objectives:        - To study genetic changes related to breast lesions, including breast cancer, in African       American women.        Eligibility:        - African American women at least 18 years of age who are nursing a baby and who either have       had or are being considered for a breast biopsy.

They will            collect two breast milk samples, one from each breast. They will also fill out a            questionnaire about their medical history.          -  The box with the samples and the questionnaire will be returned to the clinical center            for study.          -  After the box is returned, participants will be asked to provide a copy of the biopsy            report for any breast biopsies they have had.          -  There will be a followup phone call every year. Participants will provide health            history information. This information will include whether they have been diagnosed            with breast cancer in the previous year. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Increasing evidence supports the importance of the role of pregnancy, lactation and       post-weaning breast remodeling in the etiology of certain types of early onset aggressive       breast cancers, including basal breast cancers, which are difficult to detect and treat and       disproportionately affect African American women. Thus, improving methods for detecting or       preventing early onset tumors is important from a clinical, public health and racial       disparities perspective. Recent evidence indicates that analysis of breast milk during the       postpartum period may advance the discovery of mechanisms and biomarkers related to risk of       early onset, aggressive tumors. However, developing methods for collecting, processing and       testing milk for biomarkers poses challenges.        A research team co-led by Drs. Mark Sherman NCI/DCEG/HREB and Kathleen Arcaro University       of Massachusetts has received an NIH Bench-to-Bedside award for a project entitled,       Molecular Epidemiology of Postpartum Involution of the Breast: Development and Demonstration       of Tools for Understanding the Postpartum Period in Relation to Risk for Early Onset Breast       Cancer. The specific bench objectives of this project include:          1. To develop improved methods for fractionating breast milk into epithelial cell rich and            liquid components          2. To optimize assays for DNA methylation, proliferation, apoptosis, p16 expression and            telomere lengths using epithelial enriched breast milk fractions, and          3. To develop assays for TGF-beta ligands, prolactin and sex -steroid hormone using liquid            milk fractions.        To achieve these objectives, NCI will initially work with fresh specimens that are being       prospectively collected under the University of Massachusetts IRB-approved open protocol       entitled Epigenetics and Breast Cancer Risk in African American Women , funded by the Avon       Foundation for Women. Dr. Arcaro s lab is studying breast cancer risk and promoter       hypermethylation in breast cells obtained from the milk of nursing women. They have analyzed       breast cells from nearly 400 women and are continuing with long-term follow-up. However, the       majority of the data has been from White women. Since disease risk factors differ between       ethnic groups, it is important to test risk assessment methods on a wide population. The       main purpose of this specific UMass study is to extend their findings of breast cancer risk       to African American women. They plan to recruit 200 lactating African American women to       participate in the breast milk study. This involves collecting questionnaire data,       completing methylation analyses for eight genes, archiving milk and the remaining DNA for       future studies, and annual follow-up.        The key aims that we seek to address through the current protocol are related to objective       1 listed above: To develop improved methods for fractionating breast milk into epithelial       cell rich and liquid components. Given that Dr. Arcaro has an IRB approved open protocol to       collect fresh milk at University of Massachusetts, NCI can only pursue this collaborative       aim effectively within the timeframe of the bench-to-bedside award in the context of this       ongoing study. Specifically, the collaborative project that is the subject of this IRB       application will assess the following aims through in vitro manipulation of fresh liquid       milk collections: 1 the effects of modifying the initial rinse of epithelial pellets rinse       solution: saline vs. media; centrifugation speeds, temperature; 2 yields of cells and       nucleic acids achievable via fractionation of milk using different types of immunomagnetic       beads coated with antibodies to remove leukocytes  negative selection  vs. coated with       antibodies to remove epithelial cells  positive selection ; 3 the relative preservation       at room temperature at 24, 48 and 72 hours of milk suspended in cellular fixatives e.g.       formalin, Proclin as compared to fresh milk without fixation; 4 the possibility that       strategies 1 and 2 be combined. This project brings together specific experience and       expertise at University of Massachusetts with regard to milk processing with technical       knowledge from NCI, provided by Drs. Kopp, Heckman, Yang and Sherman. In particular, NCI       Frederick and Dr. Heckman have successfully used immunomagnetic bead technology to purify       epithelial cells from blood products and lactating mouse glands by removing leukocytes.

However, drug treatment only succeed       in restoring blood flow in a minority of people with clots in the larger arteries 10-25%       depending on the size of the blood vessel and these people also have the most severe       strokes and highest risk of death or dependence as a result of the stroke. Current best       treatment is therefore least effective in the group with the most severe strokes. Devices       that can be fed through the blood vessels to either remove or break up the blood clot in the       brain vessels can open this type of large artery blockage. However, using these devices is a       highly skilled procedure and it takes some time both to set up the necessary facilities       including anaesthetic, nurses and medical support and to reach the blockage. The extra       time that is required to use these devices may mean that brain tissue is already       irreversibly damaged. If so, then an individual patient cannot benefit and indeed may be       harmed by opening the artery. There are no completed clinical trials comparing the outcome       in people treated with standard stroke treatment and those treated with devices. PISTE is a       randomised, controlled trial to test whether additional mechanical thrombectomy device       treatment improves functional outcome in patients with large artery occlusion who are given       IV thrombolytic drug treatment as standard care.

The present       study seeks to describe the incidence and duration of delirium in this group of patients,       before and after the introduction of standardized screening tool and a guideline for       treatment of delirium after cardiac surgery. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Delirium is a common yet under diagnosed condition in cardiac surgery patients, and may       cause prolonged cognitive impairment and increased risk of complications. Patients are at       risk of e.g. pulling catheters and lines and may fall attempting to get out of bed. The       aging patient population present with many risk factors for developing delirium, but       diagnostic tools have been few. Almost 50% present with hypoactive delirium, which is often       not diagnosed, nor treated correctly. To optimize effect, treatment should be initiated       early, maintained until clinical improvement is observed, and then tapered gradually.       Recently, Delirium Observation Screening scale DOS scale was developed and validated in       elective cardiac surgery patients in the Netherlands, with interesting results.

These rhythms may be            different in people with movement disorders, such as dystonia involuntary muscle            movement, cramps, or tremors. Understanding these rhythms may provide more information            about movement disorders.          -  Focal hand dystonia, also known as writers cramp or musicians cramp, is a painful            condition that affects the hand and arm muscles. Researchers want to use transcranial            magnetic stimulation TMS to study brain rhythms in people with and without focal hand            dystonia.        Objectives:        - To better understand brain rhythms involved in focal hand dystonia.        Eligibility:          -  Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who are right-handed and have focal hand            dystonia.          -  Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.        Design:          -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.          -  This study includes two tests: a pilot test and a main test. The pilot test will            determine the frequency of TMS that will be used in the main test. Participants may be            in one or both tests. Each test requires a single outpatient visit that will last up to            5 hours.          -  Participants will have a base test to see how their muscles respond to TMS. This will            look at the electrical activity of the muscles. Participants will have a wire coil held            on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil. It creates a            magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Researchers will test the TMS on the right            and left sides of the head. This will help find the spot that activates the finger            muscles, and see how much TMS is needed.          -  In the main test, participants will have repetitive TMS rTMS. rTMS involves repeated            magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts. There will be four pulses in each burst.            Participants will have multiple bursts during the test. This test will look at how the            muscles of the hand and fingers respond to brain stimulation.          -  Treatment for focal hand dystonia will not be provided as part of this study. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Objectives:        The purpose of this protocol is to improve understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia       by performing an electrophysiological study using transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS.       The study may reveal new information about the role of gamma frequency oscillations in       cortical facilitation in dystonia patients versus healthy volunteer subjects.        The findings of this study may also help to determine if abnormal gamma frequency       facilitation might become a potential diagnostic tool for dystonia.        < TAB>        Study population:        1. We intend to study 13 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with a diagnosis of focal hand       dystonia. Thirteen subjects for each group are needed based on the power analysis, with an       additional three added to the requested accrual to account for drop-outs, yielding a maximum       of 16 subjects per group. Up to 15 focal hand dystonia patients and 15 healthy volunteers       may be involved in the pilot experiment. The pilot study will be stopped when a trend in the       data emerges, so the total number of subjects who participate in the pilot study may end up       being less than the maximum requested accrual of 15. Subjects in the pilot experiment are       eligible to later participate in the main experiment.        Design:        The subject will be seated with EMG surface electrodes over the First Dorsal Interosseous       FDI muscle of each hand monitoring muscle activity. The TMS coil will be placed on the       surface of the head and the region of motor cortex corresponding to the respective hand       muscle control. The baseline motor evoked potential MEP for the FDI muscle will be       determined by TMS stimulation and EMG monitoring. A pilot experiment will be performed       first. Conditioning stimuli, consisting of repetitive subthreshold TMS stimulation with       three pulses at one of eight frequencies, will be delivered. A test stimulus, consisting of       a single TMS pulse, will follow the conditioning stimuli at the same interval as the       conditioning train, but at a suprathreshold intensity in order to determine the MEP       amplitude. After every 5 subjects the pilot data will be analyzed to check for a trend in       the frequencies that lead to facilitation. Once a trend emerges, the pilot study will be       stopped. The four frequencies with the greatest trend toward facilitation will then be       selected and used in the main experiment. The main experiment will be performed the same way       as the pilot experiment, but will use only the four frequencies found in the pilot       experiment. Conditioning stimuli, consisting of repetitive subthreshold TMS stimulation with       three pulses at one of the selected four frequencies, will be delivered. A test stimulus,       consisting of a single TMS pulse, will follow the conditioning stimuli at the same interval       as the conditioning train, but at a suprathreshold intensity in order to determine the MEP       amplitude.        Outcome measures:        We will compare the MEP amplitude following TMS conditioning with the baseline MEP amplitude       prior to conditioning. The effect on MEP will then be compared between healthy volunteers       and dystonia patients.

As casualties of motor vehicle accidents, criminal acts or terrorism are arriving to the ER,       it is almost impossible to conclude who will overcome his psychiatric trauma and will be       able to return to his normal life course and who will be thrown out of his promising life       trajectory.        Current attempts to identify those who are at the greatest risk are still unsatisfactory,       which comprise a therapeutic dilemma, since the interventions used to ameliorate and prevent       the occurrence of PTSD in a high-risk patient, might be counter-productive and even       precipitate the emergence of PTSD in lower-risk patients.        Since PTSD is closely related to the Fight, Flight or Freeze reaction, it has much to do       with the autonomic nervous system and the major stress hormone, cortisol. Despite many       studies demonstrating the involvement of those factors in the development of PTSD, various       attempts to profile the direction of the association between PTSD and cortisol abnormalities       have yielded conflicting results.        The introduction of a novel method of assessing the excretion of cortisol using residues in       the human hair shaft, has allowed an unprecedented evaluation of its activity over a       prolonged period of time.        Using this novel method of cortisol assessment, the investigators aim to identify biomarkers       that will be able to aid in the prediction of PTSD development ahead of symptoms emergence,       and will enhance the understanding of the physiological mechanism involved and etiology of       this disorder. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD stems from an event that is perceived as a threat to       the physical and psychological integrity of the individual. Despite evidence pointing at       predisposing or protective factors, it is extremely difficult to predict who will develop       PTSD after exposure to a traumatic event. However, it is of a paramount importance to       predict such a clinical course, in order to intervene at an early stage and facilitate       research that may lead to prevention of the disorder.        As certain features of PTSD closely resemble the response of the adrenergic system via the       fight or flight mechanism, substantial effort was made to understand the role of the       hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal HPA axis and the autonomic nervous system ANS in the       development and maintenance of this disorder.        Various studies demonstrated conflicting findings, both in the trend of the level of       cortisol and in the timing of the endocrinological anomaly. Additional study assessed the       effect of HPA axis suppression by dexamethasone on anxiety-related symptoms in healthy       volunteers subjected to a stress test. Those participants whose HPA axis was inhibited,       presented a significant increase in anxiety symptoms, compared to a control group.        Variability and lack of stability are the main disadvantages of current methods quantifying       systemic cortisol levels via measurements in the plasma, urine and saliva. These       shortcomings undermine the effort to understand the role of the HPA axis in PTSD. Variable       timing of the tests, as well as the stress involved in psychiatric examination and       phlebotomy, are also major confounders in such an effort. Recently, the introduction of a       novel test of hair cortisol concentration HCC has enabled retrospective quantification of       cortisol levels, and thus the HPA axis activity, over a prolonged period of time.        As hair grows, unbounded cortisol is incorporated into the hair shaft in a manner that       correlates with the amount of unbounded plasma cortisol at that time period. Since scalp       hair grows at a fairly constant rate of 1cm per month, especially in the posterior vertex       area, analysis of 3cm would reflect the average level of unbounded cortisol throughout the       previous 3 months. Several studies in animals and humans have established the tests       stability over time, thus proving that the test reliably reflects major changes in the HPA       axis. Studies evaluating this novel test in the field of mental health demonstrated       variations of cortisol levels in a number of clinical populations: increased hair cortisol       levels were demonstrated for a 6 month period in depressed patients compared to controls;       communities exposed to the horrors of war in Uganda had elevated cortisol levels compared to       Ugandan communities not living in war zones; among patients with generalized anxiety       disorder GAD, there were lower hair cortisol levels in comparison with a control       population, despite similar cortisol saliva levels.        In addition to the advantage of a reliable measurement of unbound plasma cortisol levels       over time, this novel test is also easy to perform, easy to store and causes minimal       inconvenience to the patient with no actual risks.        The use of this novel method of testing for cortisol level over prolong periods of time       enables us to study the course of the HPA axis in relation to stressors: the baseline       status, the immediate aftermath and the continuous effects of the traumatic event on the       axis. Such valuable information can aid in the ongoing debate, whether the baseline function       of the HPA axis is a core predisposing factor or, in fact, a secondary causality of the       traumatic event.        Achieving better understanding of the complex interplay between those biological mechanisms       and the formation of PTSD might enable the targeting of high-risk population after traumatic       exposure with pharmacological and psychological interventions.        Study Hypothesis Main Hypothesis          1. Hair cortisol level previous to the trauma will correlate with PTSD development.             Secondary Hypothesis          2. Ratio between hair cortisol levels prior to trauma to saliva cortisol level following            the traumatic event will correlate with PTSD development.          3. Saliva cortisol level immediately after trauma will correlate with PTSD development.          4. Hair cortisol level one month post trauma will correlate with PTSD development.          5. Ratio between saliva cortisol levels to saliva alpha-amylase level both taken at ER            immediately after trauma will correlate with PTSD development.          6. Patients with a difference between hair cortisol levels 3 months prior to the traumatic            event and levels during the 3 months following it, are more prone to developing PTSD.        Study Methods Prospective observational study, performed at Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba,       Israel and Shalvata Mental Health Center, Hod Hasharon, Israel.        50 men and women arriving at Meir medical center Emergency department, as a result of a       traumatic civil event, will be recruited.        Participants will fill out demographic and medical history questionnaires, and a structured       psychiatric interview M.I.N.I will be performed to exclude any active psychiatric       disorder. If none of the exclusion criteria met, several procedures will be performed:          1. Sampling hair from the posterior vortex.          2. Sampling blood cortisol and saliva cortisol and alpha-amylase.          3. Documenting pulse at the time of admission to the ER and 6 hours following the event.          4. Filling a number of questionnaires: SLE stressful life events; BDI Beck Depression            Scale; MADRSS Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; STAI State & Trait Anxiety            Inventory; VAS-A, VAS-D; PDEQ Peritraumatic Dissociation Experience Questionnaire;            SASRQ Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire.        Psychiatric follow-up will be performed at 4 time points, in relation to the traumatic       event: After 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. During each assessment, the       following procedures will be performed:          1. Sampling hair from the posterior vortex.          2. Filling out a number of questionnaires: BDI, MADRSS, STAI, VAS-A, VAS-D, CAPS            Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, PSS PTSD Symptoms Scale.        Relevance of potential study findings The proposed study will provide novel information on       the role of the HPA axis in the development of PTSD. By answering this old, unresolved       question the investigators will achieve an understanding of the neurobiological mechanism       and may be able to predict the development of the disorder at an early, sub-clinical stage.       The results of the study will also contribute to the understanding and rationale of the       possibility of steroid treatment following an acute traumatic event.

Frequently, trastuzumab is       being combined with taxanes in the first-line setting. However, since therapy with       trastuzumab is active even in the absence of chemotherapy in HER2-positive MBC, the optimal       treatment strategy either in combination or in sequence with chemotherapy is still under       debate. This randomized phase II trial is studying a new strategy for the treatment of       metastatic breast cancer with HER2-positive. First-line treatment consists of trastuzumab       and pertuzumab, a treatment without chemotherapy. In case of disease progression,       chemotherapy with T-DM1 is then performed as second-line treatment. Third-line and further       line therapies are performed according to the physicians discretion. If this new       therapeutic strategy is as effective and better tolerated than the conventional strategy,       this would mean a serious breakthrough in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast       cancer.

SUMMARY:       This was a clinical effectiveness trial designed to compare the effectiveness, safety, and       tolerability of treatment with tapentadol prolonged release with that of oxycodone/naloxone       prolonged release in non-opioid pre-treated subjects with severe chronic low back pain with       a neuropathic pain component.        Both tapentadol and the opioid oxycodone are effective in chronic severe pain and tapentadol       and oxycodone/naloxone have shown advantages in gastrointestinal tolerability versus       oxycodone. Therefore, it was of high scientific interest to compare the latter 2 analgesics       with respect to gastrointestinal tolerability. Tapentadol may have advantages regarding the       neuropathic pain-related symptoms of low back pain due to its 2 mechanisms of action.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer DCT includes surgery followed by       radioiodine treatment. In the follow-up of patients it is necessary to induce TSH elevation       for the measurement of thyreoglobulin and/or total body scanning. There are two principal       methods to obtain TSH elevation: 1 injection of recombinant human TSH , and 2 to stop       L-thyroxin replacement for several 3-4 weeks. As use of recombinant TSH is rather       expensive, this method is not feasible in many countries. The problem with stopping       L-thyroxin is development of severe hypothyroidism for several weeks with concomitant       symptoms and signs.        Current pilot study aims to induce the necessary TSH elevation by decreasing the L-thyroxin       dose. The main hypothesis is that necessary TSH stimulation will be achieved during 4-6       weeks in majority of patients with fixed dose of L-thyroxin. Concomitantly, blood tests and       symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism will be obtained to get information about possible       deviations during treatment with low dose of thyroxin.

Cases with arterial       or venous thromboembolism managed with observation or use of vena cava filters in patients       with venous thromboembolism will be included too. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Illness treatment overview The incidence of venous thromboembolism VTE among patients with       haematological malignancies has been recently reviewed 1. For patients with lymphoma, the       incidence of VTE ranged from 1.5 to 14.6% and is 59% in patients with central nervous system       lymphoma. The incidence of VTE in patients with acute leukaemia varies with time, being       between 1.4 and 9.6% at diagnosis and between 1.7 and 12% during induction therapy. Notably,       the highest rates of VTE were reported in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, with       values between 6 and 16% in the largest series. In patients with multiple myeloma who did       not receive antithrombotic prophylaxis, the rate of VTE increased to 26% in those undergoing       treatment regimens including immumodulatory drugs thalidomide and lenalidomide 1.       Moreover, in patients who have undergone autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell       transplantation HSCT, the rate of VTE is between 2.9 to 9.9%, and was central venous       catheter CVC-associated in the majority of cases 2-4. VTE has been shown to occur even       during periods of severe thrombocytopenia; one-third of the events from a patient series       occurred when the platelet count was <50 x109/L 3. Patients with acute leukaemia have a       high risk of haemorrhage, mostly related to thrombocytopenia as a result of haematological       disease and/or chemotherapy, such that the administration of anticoagulant drugs in this       setting is problematic. No randomised controlled trials have addressed the issue of VTE       treatment in patients with acute leukaemia, and the management of these cases is based only       on small groups of patient series or experts opinion. Five reports have described in detail       cases of paediatric or adult patients with malignancies and thrombocytopenia who have been       treated with heparin as a result of a VTE 5-9. Out of a total of 54 cases, 32 had       haematological malignancies and a platelet nadir <50 x109/L reviewed in ref. 10. The       majority of patients 22 of 32 had CVC-related thrombosis. A full dose of low molecular       weight heparin LMWH bid was administered to the majority of the patients with CVC-related       thrombosis and to the totality of patients for whom the thrombosis was not CVC-related. All       patients received platelet transfusions if the platelet count fell below <20-40 x109/L, and       the dose of LMWH was halved when the platelet count was <20 x109/L in one report. None of       the patients had major bleeding. Rethrombosis occurred in three of 32 9.3% patients 6,7.       In a large series of 379 patients with acute leukaemia, treatment for 20 patients who had       one n=16 or two n= 4 VTE events was essentially based on the administration of       enoxaparin 100 U/kg bid; in the case of a platelet count <50 x109/L or in the clinical       suspicion of bleeding risk the dose was reduced to 100 U/kg qd or 50 U/kg bid.       Alternatively, the patients received a continuous i.v. infusion of unfractionated heparin       UFH to obtain aPTTs in the lower therapeutic range 1.5 times greater than the basal       value. Secondary prophylaxis after acute VTE was based on the administration of enoxaparin       100 U/kg qd in the case of ongoing chemotherapy or vitamin K-antagonists VKA INR between       2 and 3 otherwise. In general, the length of secondary prophylaxis was reported to be not       longer than six months 11. The safety of therapeutic anticoagulation treatment for the       management of thrombocytopenic patients was also evaluated in two series of patients       receiving HSCT 12,13. In 10 patients with multiple myeloma who had received autologous       HSCT, anticoagulation was required following pre-transplant CVC-related subclavian vein       thrombosis n= 8, pulmonary embolism two months prior to transplant n= 1, or a history of       acute intermittent atrial fibrillation that was complicated by an arterial embolus to the       leg n= 1. Beginning on the first day of high-dose chemotherapy, the 10 patients received       therapeutic UFH a 5,000 U i.v. bolus followed by 1,000 U per h to maintain aPTTs between       50 and 70 seconds and were switched to VKA treatment when their conditions stabilised. UFH       treatment was interrupted once the VKA administration produced a therapeutic INR >2 for two       consecutive days. Heparinised patients received platelet transfusions to maintain counts >30       x109/L. Three patients developed bleeding haematuria, haematemesis, mucosal bleeding that       did not not require transfusion, and no thrombotic events occurred 12. In another series       of 26 patients with HSCT who were given enoxaparin for the treatment of VTE, 21 patients had       haematological malignancies. There were 25 VTE events recorded four patients had two events       at different sites and 11 cases had upper extremity CVC-related deep venous thrombosis.       During periods of thrombocytopenia <55 x109/L, enoxaparin administration was reduced to a       median value of 49 U/kg/day range 34-75 and was withdrawn in some instances when the       platelet count fell below 20 x109/L. Two major bleeding events 8% occurred, in one case       fatal 13. The aforementioned data are insufficient for the production of evidence-based       guidelines. Experts and the AIEOP Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia       Pediatrica have suggested that the first two weeks of treatment should consist of the       administration of full-dose LMWH anti-factor Xa level 0.5-1 U/ml, maintaining the platelet       count above 50 x109/L. After the first two weeks, halving the dose is recommended if the       platelet count is between 20 and 50 x109/L. If the platelet count is below 20 x109/L, it is       advised that the LMWH therapy be discontinued until the platelet count recovers to greater       than 20 x109/L 14-16. Recent guidelines of the SISET Società Italiana per lo Studio       dellEmostasi e della Trombosi also suggested that in patients with haematological       malignancies and VTE LMWH should be preferred over VKA either for the first six months or a       longer time 17. Arterial thrombosis has been rarely reported in patients with acute       leukemia as heralding manifestation or complicating the course of disease 18-21. However,       details concerning antithrombotic treatment and the platelet count at the time of the event       are lacking in the majority of the reported cases. There have been no published studies       concerning the use of novel antithrombotic agents such fondaparinux, direct thrombin or       factor Xa inhibitors, in patients with haematological malignancies or thrombocytopaenia.       However, in vitro experiments that have been performed on plasma from children with ALL and       antithrombin deficiency as a result of the administration of asparaginase have demonstrated       that the direct thrombin inhibitor melagatran generates a consistent anticoagulant response       that is independent of the antithrombin level. Therefore, this drug class may have important       potential for use in this field 22.        Rationale Data about treatment of arterial or venous thromboembolism in patients with       haematological malignancies and thrombocytopenia are mainly anecdotal. The very limited       knowledge in this setting does not allow to plan a randomized controlled trial, lacking a       standard of care and being quite uncertain the benefits and risks of different strategies.       Therefore we planned an observational study either retrospective and prospective to gain       information about efficacy and safety of different therapeutic strategies in patients with       hematologic neoplasms and platelet count <50 x109/L having had diagnosis of arterial or       venous thromboembolism.

We hypothesize that patients treated with a subperiosteal drainage do not show higher       recurrence rates than those treated with a subdural drainage, and suffer less complications. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Chronic subdural haematoma cSDH is one of the most frequent neurosurgical entities,       affecting elderly people and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Its       incidence is reported to be 1.7-13.1 per 100000 inhabitants per year, yet there has been a       steady increasing incidence as the result of prolonged life expectancy in recent years.       Surgical treatment is recommended in case of neurological symptoms. In the only evidence       based review of the different surgical treatment modalities of cSDH, Weigels study group       concluded that bure-hole craniostomy with irrigation and drainage has the best cure to       complication ratio. A randomized controlled study of Santarius and his colleagues showed a       reduced recurrence and mortality while placing a subdural drainage compared to no drainage       after burr hole evacuation of cSDH. Gazzeri et al. and Zumofen et al. used closed       subperiosteal drainage instead of the commonly used subdural drainage. They showed equal or       superior results in outcome, complications and postoperative symptoms compared to previous       studies. Since the subperiosteal drainage is not positioned in direct contact to cortical       structures, bridging veins or haematoma membranes it is considered safer and should be       favored over a subdural drainage. Bellut et al. compared in their institute retrospectively       48 patients treated with subperiosteal drainage to 65 patients with subdural drainage and       found no difference in recurrence rate of cSDH, yet less mortality and fewer serious       complications in the group treated with subperiosteal drainage. However in their study none       of the results showed a significant difference, and they concluded that further randomized       studies with larger patient number are needed. In a recently published prospective       randomized study Kaliaperumal et al. concluded that the recurrence rate in subperiosteal       drainage is equal to subdural drainage, yet the modified ranking scalemRS of the patients       with subperiosteal drainage after 6 months was significantly better. However, the mRS score       preoperative were better in the subperiosteal drain group causing a statistical bias. In       addition the amount patients studied was small 25 per group and the recurrence rate was       overall at 0%, with a very low morbidity and mortality compared to the literature. Due to       these bias the authors recommend further prospective and randomized studies with larger       group of patients.        To date in neurosurgery practice evidence based guidelines on which drainage should be used       in cSDH do not exist and both methods, subdural drainage and subperiosteal drainage, are       being practiced, depending on the institute and/or the practicing neurosurgeon.        The aim of our study is to investigate in randomized controlled fashion whether the       recurrence and complication rate, after insertion of subperiosteal drainage in the treatment       of chronic subdural haematoma, is higher compared to insertion of subdural drainage.

SUMMARY:       It is a randomized prospective controlled study evaluating the effect of transcatheter renal       denervation on the clinical status of patients with chronic heart failure and its safety       procedures. The working hypothesis of the study is that by performing transcatheter renal       denervation in patients with chronic heart failure and severe left ventricular systolic       dysfunction there will a resultant reduction in the renal sympathetic activation which in       turn will reduce the number of hospitalizations and deaths from heart failure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Chronic heart failure in the European countries occurs in 2-3% of the population with a       significant increase in the higher age groups 1. Improved treatment of acute conditions       especially myocardial infarction has resulted in more patients entering into the category       of chronic heart failure. Chronic heart failure has a poor prognosis. Diagnosis and       treatment are challenging both medically and economically. Half of the patients with       systolic heart failure die within 4 years and more than 50% of patients with severe heart       failure NYHA functional class of IV die within one year 1. The current treatments for       heart failure are not only aimed at influencing the symptoms, but also preventing the       progression of heart failure to reduce mortality.        Heart failure leads to the activation of compensatory mechanisms designed to restore       adequate cardiac output. These mechanisms are initially beneficial, but their long-term       activation leads to further progression of the pathological process and deterioration of       cardiac function. One of the basic pathophysiological processes in heart failure is       excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This causes increased levels of       circulating catecholamines which is proportional to the severity of the disease that is       patients with the highest levels of norepinephrine have the worst prognosis. Beta-blocker       therapy which is designed to inhibit activity of sympathetic nervous system causes milder       symptoms of heart failure in patients by modifying disturbed hemodynamics and ultimately the       clinical status. In recent years, the therapeutic efficacy of beta-blockers in chronic heart       failure has been verified in a number of controlled clinical trials 2-5. These studies       have confirmed that long-term treatment with beta-blocker therapy alleviates the symptoms of       heart failure, improves the clinical condition of the patients and reduces mortality like       ACE inhibitors.        High activity of renal sympathetic nerves in patients with chronic heart failure is an early       predictor of increased mortality 6. The main pathophysiological basis of this finding is       probably excessive sodium retention due to direct activation of sympathetic fibers       innervating renal tubules 7. Recent experimental work on animals have shown that surgical       renal denervation inhibits an increase in renal vascular resistance, prevents a decrease in       renal blood flow 8, and also prevents changes in expression of angiotensin receptors in       the kidney 8.        Surgical sympathectomy began to be used for the treatment of severe and malignant       hypertension more than 50 years ago. But this was a rather complicated procedure, which was       accompanied by a number of adverse effects orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia,       shortness of breath, bowel and sexual disorders]. Moreover it required a long       hospitalization of 2-4 weeks and then required a recovery period of 1-2 months. However this       intervention led to a rapid decrease in pressure and a higher survival rate after surgery in       a large observational study9.        In recent years a method has been developed in which destruction of renal sympathetic nerves       that are present in the adventitia of renal arterial walls is done by catheterization 10.       This procedure uses a catheter with a radiofrequency ablator at its tip Symplicity, Ardian       / Medtronic, USA, which is introduced through the femoral artery and then progressively       introduced into the renal arteries. A randomized study has demonstrated that this procedure       has a high degree of safety for the patients and a high rate of efficacy as well. In       patients with resistant hypertension treated with transcatheter renal denervation there was       a significant drop in blood pressure of 33/11 mmHg p < 0.0001 that occurred after 6 months       compared to a control group receiving unmodified pharmacological treatment 11.

One of the health consequences of chronic       stress at work is an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Emergency physicians       subjectively complain of stress related to changes in work shifts. In occupational medicine,       no marker of stress or fatigue has achieved consensus. Several potential biomarkers of       stress have been described, but never investigated in emergency physician, who may represent       a good model of stress due to the complex interplay between stress life-and-death       emergencies, which is the defining characteristic of their job, lack of sleep and fatigue       due to repeated changes in shifts.The aim of this study was to compare HRV in emergency       physicians working a 24-hour shift 24hS or a 14-hour night shift 14hS, and in those       working a control day clerical work on return from leave. We will also follow these       markers three days following each shift D3/24hS and D3/14hS.

Potential biomarkers will be assessed through urine and       saliva collections. Heart rate variability will be measured using 5-lead electrocardiogram.       Psychological questionnaires will be completed only once during the control day. The       workload during each shift will be estimated by: the total number of entries, the number of       admissions, the number of outpatients collected by computer, and the number of life-and-       death emergencies given by the emergency physician. Sleep duration, including naps, will       be assessed by questionnaire bed time - wake time on the three-day tracking of each shift       and on the control day.        Shift randomization: Latin squares were used to randomize the pattern of shifts and control       day 24hS then 14hS then control day or any other combination.        Gaussian distribution of the data wil be tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data will be       presented as mean ± standard deviation SD. Comparisons between shifts will be made with       ANOVA. Relationships between data will be assessed by Pearson correlation. Significance will       be accepted at the p<0.05 level. Statistical procedures will be performed using SPSS       Advanced Statistics software SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL.

Most of the attention       in treating ischemic heart disease IHD is understandably directed toward treating coronary       artery disease. However there are other treatable culprits in these patients.        Left ventricular hypertrophy LVH is widespread in IHD patients, even in the absence of       hypertension. It is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. In       one study, the presence of LVH was a stronger predictor of mortality than either multivessel       cor-onary disease or impaired LV function.        Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent with a history of successful use in type 2 diabetes.       In the UKPDS United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, metformin was associated with a       39% lower risk of myocardial infarction compared with conventional therapy. Metformin also       offered dual benefits of improving vascular function and lessening ischemia in nondiabetic       patients.        Hence, the main aim of this study was to assess whether metformin could regress LVM in       patients with IHD. The secondary aim was to assess the effect of metformin on LV volumes and       endothelial function in this patient group. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  They had to have normal glucose tolerance.            -  They had to have either angiographically documented coronary artery disease or a              previous history of myocardial infarction.            -  They were required to have an office BP < 130/80 mm Hg            -  The presence of LVH on echocardiography American Society of Echocardiography              criteria LVM index [LVMI] > 115 g/m2 for men and > 95 g/m2 for women.

Based on       the EAST Management Guidelines for the prevention of VTE in trauma patients, a number of       research questions could be addressed by a thorough current literature review combined with       a multicenter concurrent analysis. This proposal seeks to create a data registry of trauma       patients from multiple trauma centers around the United States that will serve as a platform       for the study of VTE. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The VTE related research questions, identified by the EAST Management Guidelines as needing       further study, are:          1. While numerous risk factors for VTE have been identified and reported, there are only 2            that have Level 1 evidence to support them—spine fracture and spinal cord injury. Many            of the other reported risk factors were identified in studies that did not have            protocols for surveillance, reported only on patients with symptoms, or used data from            large administrative databases such as the National Trauma Data Bank4. It has also been            shown that the frequency of diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis DVT increases when            more duplex imaging of the extremities is undertaken5. Thus, if an aggressive            concurrent surveillance program for DVT and aggressive work up of suspected pulmonary            embolism PE is undertaken:               1. Are there unknown or under-reported risk factors?               2. Is there a hierarchy of risk among the factors? For example, is a long bone                 fracture associated with a higher incidence of VTE than a closed head injury?               3. Do all closed head injuries with an AIS>3 have the same degree of risk or is an                 epidural hematoma more risky than a subdural hematoma?               4. What constitutes high and very high risk?          2. What is the comparative efficacy and value6 of unfractionated heparin UH, low            molecular weight heparin LMWH and direct thrombin inhibitors DTI with or without            associated mechanical prophylaxis MP in preventing VTE in trauma patients? In            examining this question, the morbidity of these agents must be carefully determined,            particularly with respect to intracranial injury and intra-abdominal solid viscus            injury.          3. In trauma patients who develop VTE what is the best treatment and for how long?          4. Should all trauma patients who develop proximal deep venous thrombosis pDVT undergo a            workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of inverse risk            inverse risk meaning a patient with a minor injury, who is thought to be at low risk,            who develops pDVT? Similarly, should trauma patients who develop pulmonary embolism            PE undergo a workup for thrombophilia or should this be based up the degree of            inverse risk [question 4 adds importance to answering questions 1a and 1b]?          5. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies suggests that prophylactic inferior            vena cava filters PICVF significantly reduce the risk of PE OR: 0.09-0.497. The            authors of the meta-analysis point out a number of methodological flaws with the            studies selected for the analysis. Most importantly, all were retrospective studies            with historical controls and the use of pharmacologic prophylaxis was not uniform among            the studies evaluated. Despite this report, there is continued significant practice            variation in the use of PIVCF and the role of PIVCF in the care of trauma patients            remains at question. Thus, if an aggressive concurrent surveillance program for DVT and            aggressive work up of suspected PE is undertaken:               1. Are all patients perceived to be at high risk for VTE who also have a relative or                 absolute contraindication to pharmacologic prophylaxis receiving a PIVCF?               2. Do PIVCF reduce the risk of PE in trauma patients in whom risk adjustment has been                 done?               3. Do PIVCF have value for the trauma patient at very high risk for VTE, the high                 risk trauma patient or the moderate risk trauma patient? In examining this                 question, the morbidity of PIVCF must be carefully determined, particularly with                 respect to their placement including local complications at the insertion site,                 their migration and degree of tilt and long-term complications.          6. Because most DVT is asymptomatic the clinical examination is extremely insensitive.            Therefore, surveillance of the lower extremity venous systems is necessary. However,            the use of routine surveillance is controversial. It is also known that venous duplex            exams, while very accurate in the symptomatic patient, can be quite insensitive in the            asymptomatic patient. In addition, surveillance scanning is hampered by external            fixators and wounds as many as 30% of extremities cannot be scanned for this reason10.            Finally, it is not uncommon for trauma patients to have a PE even a fatal PE with            negative followup surveillance of the lower extremity LE and upper extremity UE            venous systems. This would suggest either that the surveillance duplex was inaccurate,            or the clot arose in a vein that could not be well interrogated by duplex i.e., the            hypogastric, or that the clot arose de novo in the pulmonary artery11. Thus, if an            aggressive concurrent surveillance program for DVT and aggressive work up of suspected            PE is undertaken:               1. Does protocolized surveillance surveillance of asymptomatic patients have                 value? In other words, does the quality of the outcome determining the presence                 of asymptomatic thrombus in the vein of an extremity justify the cost?               2. What constitutes the most effective protocol in terms of when the initial scan                 should be done and the frequency of subsequent scans?               3. What is the fate of peroneal vein and tibial vein clot? Does it vary depending on                 the degree of risk i.e., more likely to propagate in patients who are at the                 highest risk compared to patients with lower risk? The same question could be                 posed with respect to soleal vein or gastrocnemius vein clot.               4. Does magnetic resonance venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a                 surveillance modality—particularly those with pelvic fractures or severe LE                 fractures that cannot be reliably scanned?               5. Does contrast venography have a role in high risk trauma patients as a                 surveillance modality, particularly in patients who have had a PE and who have a                 negative duplex?               6. Since it has been shown by numerous authors that there is surveillance bias with                 regard to the diagnosis of DVT i.e., the diagnosis is more often reported at                 hospitals doing more frequent scanning5, does the frequency of the diagnosis of PE                 increase as the number of chest CT angiograms are performed?          7. Recent studies suggest an association between local14 or systemic11 inflammation and            pulmonary thrombosis perhaps not embolism. Is there an increased risk of DVT or            primary pulmonary thrombosis for trauma patients who have an associated inflammatory            process such as sepsis, urinary tract infection UTI or pneumonia PNA? What            constellation of local injury puts a patient at risk for pulmonary thrombosis?        We are proposing to perform an extensive literature review on each of these questions to       produce a state of the art publication in follow-up of the EAST Management Guidelines and to       provide a platform for a multicenter study of each or all of these questions.        METHODS          1. Literature Review. The literature review of each question will cover the period            1989-2011. The year 1989 was selected because that was the year of the last major            literature review the exception is the review by Rogers ref who authored the EAST            Management Guidelines. Each review will begin with a literature search performed under            the guidance of a medical librarian using appropriate key words and MeSH medical            subject headings. The bibliography of key articles will also be reviewed for pertinent            literature. Authors of the review will select criteria relevant to the question that            will be used to select articles to be used in the review.          2. Center Selection. Centers selected for inclusion in the multicenter studies must have            an interest in VTE, a research and publication track record on the subject, and be            willing to participate by submitting their de-identified data to Scripps Mercy. The            centers will be selected by Drs. Steven Shackford and Frederick Rogers, recognized            experts in the field of VTE in trauma.          3. Study Design. Observational cohort.          4. Patients. All adult age > 18 trauma patients admitted to each of the centers with an            expected length of stay LOS of > 72 hours will be eligible for inclusion.          5. Interventions. Each patient will undergo a risk assessment for VTE in compliance with            the Surgical Care Improvement Program SCIP-VTE 1 & 212, which is currently being done            by most hospitals. Provided that there are no absolute or relative contraindications,            each patient will receive appropriate VTE prophylaxis in compliance with the SCIP for            the duration of their hospitalization. The use of SCIP is a condition of participation            in Medicare and poses no additional risk and no alteration in care of trauma patients.            Surveillance for VTE will not be affected by participation in the study, but will be            whatever is usual and customary for the participating institution. Similarly, the            management of patients who develop VTE will not be affected by participation in the            study, but will be whatever is usual and customary for the participating institution.          6.

The       development of phased array transducers allows for tightly focused treatment volumes and for       the ability to compensate for distortions by tissue inhomogeneities. The landmark advance in       MRgFUS for neurosurgeons occurred as the ability to sonicate through the intact cranium was       achieved with phased array transducers and acoustic modeling using CT reconstructions of the       skull. By coupling HIFU with MRI, detailed treatment plans can be generated and       intra-procedure real-time monitoring is available. Standard MR sequences have been shown to       reliably predict tissue damage during thermal lesioning with ultrasound. The precision of       the technology has already been demonstrated in animal models and is currently being       investigated in humans with brain tumors and neuropathic pain syndromes. Unlike stereotactic       radiosurgery, the treatment can be monitored continuously in real time with MRI and       MR-thermography. We anticipate that a MRgFUS non-invasive thermal lesioning is similarly as       safe as DBS or other current procedure and will provide several years of benefit through       reduction of contralateral motor symptoms and potential medication side effects in ET, while       still permitting subsequent treatment with DBS should that become clinically desirable. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1. Men and women, between 18 and 80 years, inclusive            2.

A diagnosis of ET as confirmed from clinical history and examination by a movement              disorder neurologist            4. Tremor refractory to adequate trials of at least two medications, one of which should              be either propranolol or primidone. An adequate medication trial is defined as a              therapeutic dose of each medication or the development of side effects as the              medication dose is titrated.            5. Vim nucleus of thalamus can be target by the ExAblate device. The Vim region of the              thalamus must be apparent on MRI such that targeting can be performed with either              direct visualization or by measurement from a line connecting the anterior and              posterior commissures of the brain.            6.

It was hypothesized that diagnostic CT pulmonary angiograms could       be done with less than the usual 80-120 ml of contrast used. We have developed a method of       performing diagnostic CT pulmonary angiograms with 30 ml of intravenous contrast in most       patients. The long-term objective of this study is to show that there is no difference in       the diagnostic efficacy of this low dose 30 ml technique when compared to the more       traditional full-dose technique. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Potential participants in the study will have been referred to the radiology section for a       CTPA for a suspected pulmonary embolus. The radiologist will review the patients record in       CPRS, as is done routinely in this situation. Patients with class 3 or 4 CHF,       supraventricular tachycardia, Serum Creatinine >1.5 mg/dl >1.3 mg/dl female, history of       contrast allergy, or unable to give informed consent will be excluded from both arms of the       study. Patients with serum creatinine >1.28 mg/dl require referring physician approval. If       the participant appears to qualify for the study then the study physician will contact the       referring physician and inform him/her of the study. If the referring physician is agreeable       then either the radiologist or the referring physician will approach the patient, either at       the bedside or in the radiology clinic to determine if the patient is interested in       participating in the study. If so, a study radiologist will begin the informed consent       process. After informed consent is obtained the subject will be computer randomized to       either the new low-dose or full-dose technique protocols. A total of 220 studies 110 per       group will be performed.        Multidetector CT Scan: All CT examinations will be performed on the Siemens Sensation       64-MDCT scanner. Visipaque Iodixanol 320 non-ionic isoosmolar contrast agent will be used       in all contrast examinations followed by a subsequent injection of normal saline. An       informed written consent for the injection of IV contrast will be obtained prior to all CT       examinations. Safe venous access will be obtained via either an antecubital vein or a       central venous line. For low dose CT pulmonary angiograms, 30 ml of IV Radio Contrast       Material RCM will be injected at a flow rate of 5 ml/second followed by an injection of 20       ml of normal saline at 5ml/second. The region of interest ROI will be the superior vena       cava SVC at the approximate level of the aortic arch. The scan will be triggered to begin       at 75 Hounsfield units HU. For Full dose CT pulmonary angiograms, 100 ml of IV RCM will be       injected at a flow rate of 5ml/sec. The ROI will be the main pulmonary artery. The scan will       be triggered at 120 HU. One mm contiguous axial spiral scans will be obtained from the apex       of the lung through the adrenals. Reformatted 1.5 mm axial, 3 mm axial, 1.5 mm coronal and       sagittal images will be obtained. All images will be uploaded to the AGFA Picture Archiving       Communication System PACS workstation for interpretation. The costs of all CT scans and       RCM will be covered by the Department of Imaging as the majority of the studies are part of       routine clinical care.

High frequency       oscillatory ventilation HFOV provides effective gas exchange with minimal pressure       fluctuation around a continuous distending pressure and therefore small tidal volume. Animal       studies showed that recruitment and maintenance of functional residual capacity FRC during       HFOV open lung concept could reduce lung injury.        Open lung HFOV is achieved by delivering a moderate high mean airway pressure MAP using       oxygenation as a guide of lung recruitment. Some neonatologists suggest combining HFOV with       recurrent sigh-breaths HFOV-sigh delivered as modified conventional ventilator-breaths at       a rate of 3/min. The clinical observation is that HFOV-sigh leads to more stable       oxygenation, quicker weaning and shorter ventilation. This may be related to improved lung       recruitment. This has however to our knowledge not been tested in a clinical trial using       modern ventilators.        Purpose, aims:          -  To compare HFOV-sigh with HFOV-only and determine if there is a difference in            oxygenation expressed as a/A-ratio and/or stability of oxygenation expressed as            percentage time with oxygen saturation outside the reference range.          -  To provide information on feasibility and treatment effect of HFOV-sigh to assist            planning larger studies. We hypothesize that oxygenation is better during HFOV-sigh.        Methods:        Infants at 24-36 weeks corrected gestational age already on HFOV are eligible. Patients will       be randomly assigned to HFOV-sigh 3 breaths/min followed by HFOV-only or vice versa for 4       alternating 1-hours periods 2-treatment, double crossover design, each patient being its       own control. During HFOV-sigh set-pressure will be reduced to keep MAP constant, otherwise       HFOV will remain at pretrial settings. Outcome will be calculated from normal clinical       parameters including pulx-oximetry and transcutaneous monitoring of oxygen and       carbon-dioxide partial pressures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       High frequency oscillatory ventilation HFOV has been used in neonatal respiratory care for       more than three decades. HFOV provides effective gas exchange with minimal pressure       fluctuation around a set mean airway pressure MAP functioning as a continuous distending       pressure CDP, and low tidal volume compared to conventional ventilation CV. HFOV was       therefore thought to be able to reduce the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in ventilated       preterm babies. However results from randomized controlled trials comparing HFOV with       conventional ventilation have been conflicting and meta-analyses have not shown clear       evidence that HFOV is safer or more effective than conventional ventilation neither when       used as initial strategy nor as rescue strategy in preterm babies with respiratory distress       syndrome RDS. Consequently there are no absolute indications for HFOV in preterm babies       and most neonatologists today use HFOV as a rescue mode when conventional ventilation is       failing in the acute setting of RDS as well as in the baby with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.        Maintaining adequate functional residual capacity FRC together with the fraction of       inspired oxygen FiO2 are the main determinants of oxygenation. The larger the FRC, the       larger is the volume of available oxygen in the alveoli for gas transport. Adequate oxygen       saturation SAT of the blood in room air or an improvement in oxygen-saturation without       changing the fraction of inspired oxygen can be seen as an indirect indicator of normal or       normalized FRC, and most neonatologists use oxygenation as an indirect marker for lung       volume during HFOV.        The CDP or set-MAP is the main determinant of lung-aeration during HFOV. A too low MAP may       cause non-homogenous aeration and atelectasis leading to atelectotrauma and redirection of       airflow to more compliant alveoli leading to localized hyperinflation.        Accordingly, early animal studies showed that recruitment and maintenance of FRC during HFOV       could reduce lung injury. Lung recruitment was initially achieved by superimposing       conventional ventilation CV breaths on top of HFOV with lower MAP than used today, either       as recurrent sustained inflations lasting 15-20 seconds about every 20 minute, as       intermittent sigh breaths 3-5 tidal breaths pr minute delivered as normal conventional       breaths or as conventional ventilation at normal rate combined with HFOV.        Today most neonatologists perform this so-called open lung concept by adjusting the       set-MAP using oxygenation as an indirect guide of lung recruitment. Different approaches are       used explained by difficulties in direct bedside monitoring of FRC. Some initiate HFOV with       MAP 2-3 cm H2O above the MAP needed during conventional ventilation subsequently adjusting       MAP until the fraction of inspired O2 FiO2 <0.25-0.6 providing no signs of over inflation       of the lungs on x-ray. Others go through a more complex step-wise increase in MAP till FiO2       cannot be reduced further, and then gradually decrease MAP until FiO2 again needs to be       increased to maintain a predefined SAT and then continues ventilations with a MAP set at 2       cm H2O above this point, thereby placing ventilation on the more compliant deflation limb of       the pressure-volume relationship of the lung.        During HFOV, MAP may be adjusted as mentioned above. Further increase in MAP may increase       FRC by increased aeration and consequently improve oxygenation. Although recent clinical       trials suggest this approach is safe, it could potentially lead to generalized       hyperinflation and volutrauma in addition to interfering with systemic venous return and       cardiac output especially if not combined with direct monitoring of lung volume which is       currently not available in routine clinical care.        Combining intermittent recruitment sigh breaths at a rate of 3-5 breaths/minute with HFOV       could be an alternate way of assisting in maintaining or normalizing FRC during which MAP is       only increased temporarily and intermittently. This could in theory lead to quicker weaning       in MAP, less oxygen exposure and potentially reduced lung injury. A concern however could       be, that the intermittent sigh breaths will lead to intermittent excessive pressures in       distal airways and to excessive tidal volume and accordingly not be beneficial at all.       Nevertheless the approach of combining HFOV and sigh breaths at a low rate seems to be       encouraged by a number of neonatologist.        It has however to our knowledge not yet been tested in a controlled human trial.        A search on PubMed revealed no human or animal trials comparing HFOV combined with       intermittent recruitment sigh-breaths at a low rate. Also no trials exploring this approach       are currently registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov.        To our knowledge so far only one human trial comparing HFVO with recruitment breaths at low       rate has been registered but never published Texas Infant Star Trial.        Combining HFOV with conventional breaths has only been reported in a limited number of       studies and only with focus on HFOV combined with CV at normal rate showing a possible       benefit. Similar results have been reported when comparing High frequency Jet Ventilation       HFVJ combined with CV at normal rate with HFVJ alone.        Trial rationale:        Combining intermittent recruitment sigh breaths at a low rate with HFOV could offer a       further way of assisting in maintaining or normalizing FRC with only modest or no increase       in MAP in alignment with the open lung concept.        A concern however could be, that the intermittent sigh breaths will lead to intermittent       increased pressures in distal airways and too large tidal volume and accordingly not be       beneficial at all. Despite this, the approach of combining HFOV and sigh breaths seems to be       encouraged by a number of neonatologist.        It has however, to our knowledge not yet been tested in a controlled human trial. We       therefore wish to conduct a controlled cross-over trial assessing the effect of HFOV       combined with intermittent sigh breaths on oxygenation in ventilated neonates using       oxygenation as an indirect indicator of lung recruitment.        Objective and hypothesis:        The objectives of this trial are to:        • Compare HFOV combined with intermittent recruitment sigh breaths at a rate of 3/min       HFOV-sigh with HFOV only HFOV-only and examine if:          -  oxygenation expressed as a/A-ratio improves with HFOV-sigh               -  a/A-ratio is a measure of oxygenation and calculated as               -  a/A-ratio = paO2/0,95*FiO2- PaCO2,               -  paO2 and PaCO2 are measured on arterial blood if arterial access is in situ                 otherwise as transcutaneous values see further down.          -  stability of oxygenation improves with HFOV-sigh             • expressed as a calculation of the percentage deviation of time spent outside the            reference range for oxygen-saturation SAT for the given gestational age AUC -            area-under-the-curve and comparing this with MAP and FiO2.          -  Evaluate the possibility of setting up a larger randomized controlled trial We            hypothesize that during HFOV-sigh the oxygenation will be improved as well at the            stability of oxygenation with less time spent outside the reference range for SAT at an            unchanged or lower FiO2        Trial design:        The trial is planned as a 4-period 2-treatment, double crossover clinical trial with each       patient being its own control. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive HFOV-Sigh       followed by HFOV-only or vice versa for four alternating 1-hours periods.

In this       study, eligible children will be randomized to either the Usual Care Arm or the Fluid       Sparing Arm. Children will receive treatment according to current ACCM Septic Shock       Resuscitation Guidelines, with the assigned resuscitation strategy used to guide       administration of further fluid boluses as well as the timing of initiation and escalation       of vasoactive medications to achieve ACCM recommended hemodynamic targets. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Current pediatric surviving sepsis guidelines from the American College of Critical Care       Medicine ACCM emphasize an early and goal-directed approach to resuscitation. These       guidelines suggest that fluid resuscitation should be aggressive with repeated intravenous       IV fluid boluses of 20 mL/kg, such that some children may require as much as 200 mL/kg of       fluid to achieve therapeutic endpoints. The guidelines also recommend the initiation of       vasoactive agents at the stage of fluid refractory shock, i.e. when there is persistent       hypoperfusion despite at least 60 ml/kg IV fluid. Improvements in pediatric septic shock       survival have been attributed to adherence to the first iteration of the ACCM septic shock       guidelines, and the use of goal directed targets. However, the largest and most publicized       pediatric trial of fluid resuscitation in children with suspected septic shock FEAST       Trial, published in NEJM in 2011, demonstrated an increased mortality among children       treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation in comparison to the conservative fluid       resuscitation arm. As a result, the pediatric critical care community clearly acknowledges       that these results, while important, are not necessarily generalizable to developed       countries such as Canada.        Emerging publications in the ICU literature suggest that excessive compared to conservative       fluid administration in adults with septic shock worsens outcomes such as duration of       mechanical ventilation, complications related to the third-spacing of fluids, length of ICU       stay, and mortality. A systematic review published in August 2012 reveals a paucity of       randomized controlled trial RCT evidence apart from the FEAST trial examining the impact       of fluid resuscitation on mortality in children with septic shock. This raises the important       question of whether children in developed countries would also benefit from a fluid sparing       resuscitation strategy to achieve the ACCM goal-directed targets. Use of such a fluid       sparing strategy would, by default, require earlier initiation and preferential escalation       of vasoactive medications to meet ACCM hemodynamic goals. The optimal degree of fluid       resuscitation and the timing of initiation of vasoactive support in order to achieve       therapeutic targets in children with septic shock remains unanswered.        This Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial constitutes the first step in answering our research       question of whether, in pediatric patients with septic shock, use of a fluid sparing       strategy to achieve ACCM therapeutic goals, results in improved clinical outcomes without an       increased risk of adverse events, compared to the usual care of aggressive fluid       resuscitation as currently recommended by the ACCM guidelines. The purpose of the pilot       study is to determine feasibility and inform the appropriate methodological design of the       larger multi-centre RCT to fully answer our research question.

SUMMARY:       Background:        Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI is a condition characterized by memory problems more severe       than normal cognitive changes due to old age, and less severe than dementia. Reduced working       memory WM is regarded as one of the core symptoms of an MCI-condition. Recent studies have       indicated that WM can be improved trough computer based training.        Objectives:        The objective of the study is to evaluate if working memory training is effective in       improving working memory in elderly MCI-patients. Further, to evaluate if cognitive training       relates to structural changes in the white and gray matter of the brain, assessed by       structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Cognitive phenotypes related to memory impairment and       progression to dementia will also be investigated.        Patients and Methods:        The proposed study is a blinded, randomized and controlled trail that will include 90       elderly patients from a Memory Clinic diagnosed with MCI. The groups will be randomized to       either training or a placebo version. The intervention is computerized working memory       training performed for 45 minutes over 25 sessions. Neuropsychological assessment and       structural MRI will be performed before, 6 and 12 months after training.        Relevance:        Currently there is no known treatment available for mild memory impairment/MCI, and few       studies on specific cognitive training in MCI-patients have been performed. The proposed       study has received funding from a Norwegian Health Region. If computer based training       results in positive changes to memory functions in MCI patients this may represent a new,       cost-effective treatment. Secondly, evaluation of training induced structural changes to       grey or white matter may improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind effective       cognitive interventions in MCI patients.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT01991886","TITLE:       Using Nasal High Flow From Birth in Premature Infants - a Pilot Study SUMMARY:       Recent large studies have shown that not all premature babies need to be intubated have a       breathing tube inserted and ventilated, nor do they all need to be given lung surfactant       routinely. Those studies showed that even very small babies can be safely supported using       nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure nCPAP which is applied tightly to the nose using       nasal prongs. This is a type of noninvasive ventilation NIV so that the babies continue to       breath, albeit with additional support to reduce their work of breathing. However nCPAP has       some drawbacks, including that it can cause skin damage to the nose, and that the heating       and humidification of the gas is not always sufficient. We have been using, for over 5       years, a different system to support babies after routine intubation. This is another type       of noninvasive ventilation called nasal High Flow nHF for which we use a Vapotherm       Precision Flow device. Published trials show that it is at least as effective as nCPAP to       provide NIV and to prevent the subsequent need for intubation and/or surfactant. However nHF       is superior to nCPAP in respect it does not cause nose damage and its heating and       humidification is excellent. This pilot study aims to describe and evaluate the use of nHF,       using a standard commercially available system Precision Flow, Vapotherm Inc., from birth,       in babies born less than 30 completed weeks gestation, with a view to avoiding intubation       and ventilation. This study is important to establish the feasibility of using nHF       immediately after birth. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       We propose to pilot the use of this mobile nHF unit, using the Vapotherm Precision Flow       device, in the premature population of babies who would normally be either intubated and       given surfactant routinely, or be maintained on nCPAP until arrival on the Neonatal       Intensive Care Unit NICU then transferred onto nHF. Parents will be informed about the       pilot and their permission will be sought. We aim to recruit 40 babies less than 30 weeks       gestation.        The reason for undertaking a pilot study of this nature is to establish feasibility and       proof of concept. It is not designed to be compared to using nCPAP to stabilise babies       immediately after birth although that will be the next and logical progression if this       proves to be a feasible technique.        The hypothesis is that using nHF to stabilise babies immediately after birth will confer the       same advantages as using nCPAP to stabilise babies in this way, which has been demonstrated       in the worldwide literature. For units such as ours who use nHF in preference to nCPAP, this       will be an important step in further defining the management of these babies after birth.       There is evidence that nHF is at least as good as nCPAP in preventing intubation and       reducing lung disease, and it may also offer additional advantages from humidification and       reduction in nasal trauma.        The major challenge for this pilot project will be to identify eligible deliveries in a       timely manner to ensure that a suitable member of staff is available to speak to parents and       gain consent.        Once a delivery has been identified and the parents have agreed to take part, then the       following process will take place to manage the newborn baby.        Check the mobile nHF unit          -  The mobile nHF unit should be kept plugged in so that the uninterruptable power supply            UPS is fully charged          -  To use it, unplug it to check that the UPS is functioning green lights indicate full            charge, set up a Vapotherm circuitas per normal routine and start the machine            running on UPS power supply.          -  Gas supply should be from the cylinders to check that the pressures are 50bar in both            air and oxygen cylinders          -  Set the temperature to 37 degrees Celsius          -  Once running, turn the unit off if not immediately needed or plug into the mains power            and gases where available to conserve gas. The unit can be run on a flow of 1            litre/minute whilst ticking over to conserve cylinder gas if needed.          -  The prongs should be attached to the circuit.        Once the baby is born          -  Place the baby in a polythene bag as per normal practice          -  Ensure the baby is breathing. If not, or the baby is bradycardic, then normal            resuscitation measures should be applied. It will only be appropriate to apply the            mobile nHF if the baby is breathing and is clinically stable.          -  Once the baby is born, increase the flow to 6 litres/min          -  If the baby is breathing then apply the nHF prongs and observe carefully          -  Suction should only be applied gently, if needed to remove excessive secretions in the            mouth and throat. Babies on high flow will often blow bubbles and there may be lung            fluid in the throat, but suction should not be vigorous          -  Apply a saturation monitor as per normal practice to check Heart Rate HR and Oxygen            Saturation SaO2.          -  Dry the babys face sufficiently to be able to apply duoderm dressing to stick down the            prongs to the cheeks.          -  Observe the baby carefully, ensure attention to thermal care and inform the parents            about progress.          -  As soon as the baby appears stable, move to NICU as per normal practice        Transfer to NICU          -  Two people are needed to effect the transfer from labour ward/theatre to NICU, one to            move the mobile nHF and one to move the resuscitaire.          -  On arrival in NICU, plug the mobile nHF into gas and power supplies switch the            manifold over          -  Ensure that there is a second, cotside Vapotherm empty unit          -  Leave the baby in the resuscitaire and check the admission temperature.          -  Stop the mobile nHF, remove the cartridge and place it into the cotside Vapotherm unit.            Start it running, it should run straight away.

This is more than the number of children       dying from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. The current diagnostic and management       protocols for managing serious respiratory diseases in children are 30 years old and are       greatly in need of updating. The successful establishment of useful clinical management       criteria for children with respiratory diseases will have benefits for children in low       resource regions around the world. The goals of the study are:          -  To determine if children with respiratory distress can be reliably diagnosed under            low-resource conditions.          -  To identify the clinical tests that best differentiate pneumonia from wheezy diseases.            These will be used to establish updated diagnostic criteria for common pediatric lung            diseases that broaden the current pneumonia algorithm by adding another for wheezy            illnesses.          -  The ultimate objective is to improve the management and outcome of acute respiratory            conditions in children.          -  Investigators also wish to test the efficacy of a locally developed cell phone oximeter            probe in a low resource setting. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Study organisation. This is a prospective observational study run simultaneously in four       Indian public hospitals King George Medical University, Lucknow; Regency Hospital, Kanpur;       Vanivilas Hospital, Bangalore; Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, Bangalore. The study       started in Oct 2012 to cover the Indian respiratory viral season. In order to maintain high       standards of data collection, a post-graduate research coordinator is employed at each       hospital. Because of the use of standardised scoring systems and the need for accurate       clinical data collection, a member from the Canadian team spent a week at each centre       familiarising local research team members with the study protocol and standardised scoring       systems. This was followed by a one week trial period of data collection and electronic       transmission of files to Canada.        Diagnostic definitions and standardised scores. The primary problem facing any study of       pneumonia is accurate diagnosis. The overlap of clinical and radiological findings between       severe viral infections, asthma and bacterial pneumonia can make it difficult to determine       which febrile tachypneic children have wheezy diseases and which ones would benefit from       antibiotic treatment. In many low-resource areas, this is further complicated by infectious       diseases, such as malaria and dengue, which can have similar presentations. Early WHO       tachypnea-based diagnostic protocols were intentionally over-sensitive to ensure that all       children with bacterial pneumonia received antibiotics. Later attempts were made to improve       the detection of wheezy diseases, by adding audible wheeze or acute bronchodilator response       to the basic criteria. However, these were shown to be imprecise, particularly amongst the       sickest children.        Investigators chose to formalize the diagnostic method described by Sachdev et al who       classified patients into four groups pneumonia, wheezy disease, mixed and non-respiratory       based on consultant review of a detailed history and examination plus a chest radiograph       CXR. Investigators recorded 29 items from a protocol that included history, examination,       CXR and oximetry see table. In order to combine results from data collection between       centres, standardised scoring systems for conscious level and auscultation findings were       used. For chest radiographs, a modification of the recently updated system recommended by       the WHO was used. During the one week preparatory period, the system was explained to all       involved ER physicians and pediatricians using examples and practice interpretation.        Study protocol. All children below 5 years age who present to the emergency rooms of the       study hospitals with cough or difficulty breathing of less than 5 days, are identified. If       their initial respiratory rate met WHO criteria for pneumonia, the study is explained by a       native speaker of their primary language and they are invited to enter the study. Families       are not paid to enrol but the study covers the cost of a CXR for every child plus travel       expenses for outpatients to return for review on day four. After enrolment, twenty nine       features of the childs history, examination and CXR are assessed by the ER physician and       recorded by the study coordinatorTable 2.        After reviewing the data, the ER physician is asked to place the child into one of four       diagnostic categories: pneumonia, wheezy disease asthma and bronchiolitis, mixed evidence       of pneumonia and wheeze and non-respiratory malaria, dengue etc. The ER physician is       solely responsible for subsequent management decisions. All study patients are reviewed four       days later by a qualified pediatrician who is blinded to the ER physicians CXR       interpretation and diagnosis. Based on a review of the clinical data at presentation, plus       subsequent course over 4 days and a second examination, the pediatrician places the patient       into one of the four diagnostic categories. This is considered the childs final diagnosis       for analysis.        Statistical analysis. Logistic regression analysis will be used to determine which of the       initial clinical variables had the best predictive power for pneumonia and asthma. The best       cut-off values for continuous variables were established using receiver operating curve       analysis. For each predictive variable, sensitivity, specificity plus positive and negative       predictive value will be calculated from conventional tables using standard equations. When       the predictive value of combining variables is tested, investigators will link them as A       and/or B. This increases sensitivity but decreases specificity, compared to using A and       B. Continuous variables will be displayed as mean +/- one standard deviation. Categorical       variables will be displayed with box and whisker plots where the whiskers represent full       range.        Table of investigations performed in the ER at presentation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background: Having a first child is a key marker of the transition into parenthood that       requires substantial adjustment of couples life. A recent meta-analysis published in the       Journal of American Medical Association reports that both women 23.8% and men 10.4%       suffer from perinatal depression [1]. The fathers involvement during pregnancy can       positively influence health outcomes not only for the man, but his partner, and their       children [1,2]. However, the effectiveness of fathers involvement in prenatal care in       preventing paternal and maternal depression, is still unknown.        Aims: This study seeks to: 1 evaluate the effect of a father inclusive psychoeducation       program for first-time Chinese mothers and fathers on depressive symptoms primary outcome,       marital relationships and quality of life at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year postpartum; and       2 explore fathers involvement, their perceived benefits of participating in the program       and factors influencing the effectiveness of the program.        Methods: This study employs a longitudinal, randomized, pre and post-test design. A       convenience sample of 576 couples will be recruited at antenatal clinics and randomly       assigned to one of three groups: 1 the experimental group with both couples receives the       intervention on top of usual perinatal care; 2 the comparison group with only the women       receives the intervention on top of usual perinatal care; and 3 the control group receives       usual perinatal care only. The intervention consists of a single 3-hour session during       pregnancy and two telephone follow-up at postpartum week one and week two. Primary outcome       on postnatal depression will be assessed by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary       outcomes on marital relationship and quality of life will be assessed by Dyadic Adjustment       Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12-item Health Survey, respectively, at       baseline, 6 weeks, 6 months and one year postpartum.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02011646","TITLE:       Healthy Body Study SUMMARY:       Few obesity prevention programs have produced weight gain prevention effects that persist       over long-term follow-up and those that have are extremely lengthy, averaging 52 hr in       duration, making implementation difficult and costly. The 2010 US Preventative Services Task       Force USPSTF recommendations for treating child & adolescent obesity state that programs       should have ≥ 25 hr of comprehensive treatment including dietary, physical activity and       behavioral counseling, and that programs with < 25 hr usually do not produce improvements.       The implication is that, if centers cannot provide this level of service as most cannot,       it is not worth providing any kind of treatment at all. In extreme exception to this, an       intensive 3-hr non-restrictive obesity prevention program involving participant-driven       healthy lifestyle improvement plans designed to bring caloric intake and output into balance       Healthy Weight has been found to significantly reduce increases in BMI and obesity onset       relative to alternative interventions and assessment-only controls through 3-yr follow-up.       We propose to test an extended 6-hr version of the Healthy Weight intervention in a sample       of primarily low SES, minority adolescents and young adults who are overweight and report       body dissatisfaction and subthreshold eating disorder symptoms, as these are prevalent risk       factors for obesity. We will test the hypothesis that participants assigned to the Healthy       Weight vs. control intervention will have significantly lower BMI and % body fat during       follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include body dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and       eating disorder symptoms. 300 adolescents and young adults at high risk for future weight       gain by virtue of their age, BMI percentile, body dissatisfaction and eating disorder       symptomatology will be randomized to Healthy Weight or weight control educational video.       Participants will complete assessments of BMI, body composition, potential mediators, and       other outcomes at pretest, posttest and 6--mo follow-ups in yr 1. Thus, to refute the       USPSTF recommendations statement, we propose to show that a 6-hr intervention led by       graduate students can produce significant reductions in risk for both obesity and eating       disorders, suggesting this inexpensive and brief intervention could and should be rolled out       nationwide.        Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce increases       in BMI, % body fat, and risk for onset of obesity during follow-up.        Secondary Aim: To test the hypothesis that Healthy Weight will significantly reduce body       dissatisfaction, depressive symptoms, and eating disorder symptoms.        NOTE: THIS STUDY IS ONLY OPEN TO PATIENTS AT THE MOUNT SINAI ADOLESCENT HEALTH CENTER DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Obesity is associated with increased risk of mortality, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular       disease, coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer and death from all causes Flegal et al.,       2005, is credited with over 111,000 deaths annually in the US Flegal et al., 2005,       shortens the lifespan by 5-20 years Fontaine et al., 2003 and results in $150 billion in       annual health-related expenditures Finkelstein et al., 2009. Despite alarming increases in       both adult and childhood obesity in recent decades, obesity rates in adolescents have grown       at an even faster rate Ogden et al., 2012; NCHS, 2012. Adolescent obesity has more than       tripled in the past 30 years and continues to rise Ogden et al., 2012; NCHS, 2012. Obese       adolescents are more likely to have high cholesterol and high blood pressure, prediabetes,       bone/joint problems, sleep apnea, and social and psychological problems such as       stigmatization and poor self-esteem DHHS, 2010; CDC, 2011. Unfortunately, virtually all       obesity treatments result in only transient weight loss Turk et al., 2009. Evidence       suggests that it is nearly impossible for individuals to maintain behavioral weight losses       once they have been obese for an extended period of time Ochner et al., 2013. Although       bariatric surgery can result in more persistent weight loss, this invasive procedure is       contraindicated for numerous individuals, particularly children Martin et al., 2010. Thus,       a pressing public health priority is to develop simple and effective obesity prevention       programs.        In 2010, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF issued recommendations for       screening and treating childhood and adolescent obesity. They endorsed comprehensive       moderate-to high intensity programs including counseling for weight loss, healthy diet, and       physical activity as well as instruction and support for the use of behavioral management       techniques including self-monitoring, stimulus control, eating management, contingency       management, and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. The USPSTF further defined       moderate- to high-intensity programs as > 25 hr of contact and states that such       interventions would not be feasible for implementation in a primary care setting. USPSTF,       2010, p. 365. Further, they assert that less intensive < 25 contact hours programs do not       produce significant improvements. Low-intensity interventions, defined as < 25 contact       hours over a 6-month period, did not result in significant improvement in weight status       USPSTF, 2010, p. 364. The implication is that, since most centers cannot provide this       level of service, it is not worthwhile for adolescent health centers to provide any kind of       obesity intervention at all. According to the USPSTFs website, its recommendations are       considered the gold standard for clinical preventive services. Such recommendations could       discourage the testing and implementation of brief interventions designed to prevent       obesity. Thus, to refute USPSTF statement, we propose to show that a 6-hr intervention led       by graduate students can produce significant reductions in risk for both obesity and eating       disorders, suggesting that this brief and inexpensive intervention could and should be       rolled out nationwide.

Recent information       suggests that while it is possible for most overweight adults to lose a substantial amount       of weight, maintaining the weight loss for any extended time 2 to 3 years is very       difficult. This is because trying to maintain big changes in exercise and/or eating       behaviour is very difficult in todays environment that makes sustain big changes in       behaviour Example: eat allot less or exercise allot more very hard. In fact at this time       health professionals are unsure of how best to help overweight adults maintain big       behavioral changes for long periods of time. In response, we propose that making smaller       changes in eating and exercise habits every day may be possible in todays environment and       if so, small weight changes may be possible to maintain for long periods of time. This study       is designed to assess whether making small changes in eating and exercise behavior will be       associated with sustained weight loss over three 3 years. The results of the study may       have important implications for development of public health messages and clinical       guidelines for prevention and treatment of obesity through small changes in both exercise       and eating habits. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The prevalence of obesity and associated morbidity among Canadian adults is already high and       increasing. Prevalence estimates for overweight determined from measured height and weight       now exceeds 62 % in Canadian adults1; approximately 15.5 million Canadian adults are now       overweight and obese1. Obesity is associated with a wide range of health outcomes from       co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, to       psychiatric disorders such as depression1. Direct costs attributed to obesity in Canada       range from 4.6 to 7.1 billion dollars annually1. Despite agreement concerning the urgent       need to address the obesity problem; few strategies have been successful on a wide scale       basis. Past efforts to achieve and sustain weight loss have not been particularly       successful. We3 and others4 have repeatedly demonstrated in randomized controlled trials       that most adults are not able to sustain the major changes in behaviour that are required to       maintain weight loss long term. Thus, although it is an admirable goal to substantially       reduce the number of overweight or obese Canadians, this goal may be totally out of reach in       the short term. The question then is what can be done to address the obesity problem now? We       propose that a reasonable start point in addressing the obesity problem is to develop       behavioural goals for prevention of weight gain.

Patients who       qualify, as per the inclusion criteria RASS greater than -3, less then +1, CAM positive,       present gastric access will either be given 200mg of modafinil or an identical,       indistinguishable placebo. The placebo and study drug will be distributed by the hospital       pharmacy. Once enrolled, each patient will be reassessed every morning to determine       appropriateness for drug administration. If the RASS is less than -3 i.e. comatose or       greater then 0 modafinil will not be given. He/she will then be assessed each morning       thereafter. Due to the stimulant-like actions of modafinil, the drug will be administered       only in the morning. Patients will be assessed for delirium at least twice a day; trained       personnel using the Confusion Assessment Method CAM will do the assessment. Qualification       for a delirium free day will be no positive CAM screens for 24 hours following drug       administration. Additional data such as days on mechanical ventilation and progression to       tracheotomy will also be collected hypothesizing that patients who take modafinil will have       a shorter time to extubation therefore avoiding the need for a tracheotomy. Post-discharge       from the unit, but within 48 hours, patients will be asked to participate in a survey The       Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire RCSQ assessing their perception of daytime and       nighttime sleepiness in the intensive care unit as well as their overall perception of rest.       Their functional capacity will also be evaluated at this time and compared to their       pre-morbid baseline. The hypothesis tested is that Modafinil restores sleep cycle synchrony       in the ICU therefore increasing delirium free days and improving ICU outcomes.

This       however, has only been definitively proven after a certain type of cardiac arrest that is       ventricular fibrillation / ventricular tachycardia. The purpose of this study is to       explore if total body cooling is beneficial for patients recovering from another type of       cardiac arrest that is pulseless electrical activity.        HYPOTHESIS:        Patients undergoing post-cardiac arrest therapeutic hypothermia have better neurological       outcomes if their initial arrest rhythm is pulseless electrical activity PEA in comparison       to asystole. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       STUDY RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION:        After successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest the body experiences a period of global       reperfusion. During this period, patients may show signs of myocardial stunning, lactic       acidosis, neurological injury and reperfusion syndrome. This constellation of findings       constitutes what is known as post-cardiac arrest syndrome. The brain appears to be one of       the most vulnerable organs to injury during this reperfusion phase and varying degrees of       cognitive impairment may be the end result. Inducing mild therapeutic hypothermia has been       shown to be protective for the brain in this setting and has been demonstrated to improve       neurological recovery. The evidence for this however, is only conclusive in cases where the       arrest is in a shockable rhythm i.e. pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular       fibrillation.        In 2002, two randomized controlled trials were published showing an improvement in       neurological outcomes in patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia post       resuscitation from shockable cardiac arrest. Therapeutic hypothermia has since been widely       adopted by most authorities as part of the comprehensive treatment bundle for post cardiac       arrest syndrome. Whether there is any benefit for patients arrested in non-shockable rhythms       however, is a matter of controversy. Some have reported improved mortality and better       neurological outcomes with therapeutic hypothermia in this patient population. Others have       reported no benefit or even a trend towards harm. And although the matter remains       controversial, the recommendation still stands for therapeutic hypothermia to be offered for       all comatose survivors of cardiac arrest whatever the arrest rhythm.        Most previous reports have examined the differences between shockable and non-shockable       rhythms in terms of neurological outcome and mortality rates after therapeutic hypothermia.       To our knowledge, no study has examined the differences in outcome between the two types of       non-shockable rhythms, that is pulseless electrical activity PEA and asystole. We       hypothesize that during PEA arrests, patients may retain some degree of cerebral perfusion       and hence have better neurological outcomes post-resuscitation. That is in contrast to       asystole where patients are likely to have no cerebral perfusion. In this study we attempt       to detect any possible differences in neurological recovery as indicated by the Cerebral       Performance Category scale on hospital discharge after therapeutic hypothermia, between       patients arrested in PEA arrest and those arrested in asystole.

However, preliminary randomised clinical trials       indicate that it is beneficial to reduce the sedation level in these patients. The NONSEDA       trial is an investigator-initiated, randomised, clinical, parallel-group, multinational,       superiority trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark, Norway       and Sweden, comparing no sedation with sedation and a daily wake-up trial during mechanical       ventilation.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02039999","TITLE:       An Investigation Into the Mechanism of Inhalation Cough Challenge SUMMARY:       Despite its commonplace use in respiratory medicine the mechanism whereby inhalation       challenge with a variety of mild acid aerosols produces a dose related and predictable cough       is unknown. In this proposal the investigators wish to use established cough challenge       methodology to explore the mechanism of action of agents provoking cough both in health and       disease.        The hypotheses to be tested include:          -  Intracellular changes in pH, rather than extracellular changes, are key in the            activation of TRP receptors, the main sensor for provoking cough.          -  ATP acting through P2X channels is the mechanism of increased nerve excitability            underlying cough hypersensitivity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The investigators have previously demonstrated that mild acids, such as citric, tartaric or       phosphoric acid produce a highly reliable cough challenge and that the sensitivity of these       are complex individual acids correlates within the population studied inferring a common       mechanism of action.In contrast there is no correlation with the other common cough       challenge methodology, capsaicin inferring that there are at least two different mechanisms       for producing cough with aerosols in man.        Over the past 10 years it has been established that capsaicin works by a specific irritant       receptor known as the TRPV1. A second receptor, TRPA1 has been recently discovered and we       were the first group to demonstrate that inhalation of agonists of this receptor in the form       of the extract of cinnamon cinnamaldehyde produces cough in man . TRPA1 is a very       attractive candidate for the main cough receptor since it is activated by many common       irritants, such as smoke, perfumes and other strong smells known to provoke coughing in       patients.        The investigators have cloned the human TRP receptors and expressed them in cell lines. This       in vitro work has allowed us to investigate the molecular action of the TRP receptors.       Recently, the investigators and others have shown that weak acids can activate TRPA1, not as       previously thought by stimulating the external surface of the cells but by altering the       intracellular pH. This would explain why weak and not strong acids are better at producing       cough, since weaker acids technically those with a higher pKa exist in solution in a form       which is able to cross the cell membrane and render a change in the intracellular pH, which       in turn activates TRPA1 from inside the cell.        In the first study the investigators wish to the simply alter the pH of the nebulised       solution provoking cough by altering the balance of the salts in the solution, and then       carry out standard cough challenge protocols.        In a second study the investigators wish to examine the effect of a number of known agonists       of TRPA1 which are commonly used in the perfumes and foodstuffs in order to understand the       rank order of potency of these compounds as tussive agents. This can then be compared to the       rank order of potency of the same compounds in causing intracellular pH change in in vitro       cell culture systems, in order to test the strength of the hypothesis over a variety of       different agonists.        Finally, recent work has shown that blockade of a neuronal ion channel known as P2X3 can       dramatically reduce cough. P2X3 responds to the substance adenosine triphosphate ATP,       which has previously been used as a cough challenge solution in man. If the hypothesis that       the cough hypersensitivity seen in patients is due to activation of P2X3 is correct then       patients will cough at much lower doses of ATP than normal volunteers. We wish to assess the       value of ATP, and the related substance AMP and adenosine in a cough challenge protocol.       Studying the cough produced by these naturally occurring compounds may allow us to       distinguish patients with cough hypersensitivity from those with cough due to other causes,       and also lead to a methodology important in future drug development        The greater understanding of the cough reflex which these studies would yield would have       important clinical applications pointing the way to novel therapeutic avenues, as well as       enhancing our fundamental understanding of the genesis of cough.

All nerves terminate on the fascia, where ASIS device can precisely       deliver Botox by creating that subdermal bloodless space, between the skin and muscle. Thus       enhancing and prolonging Botoxs efficacy, at the same time prevent its unnecessary adverse       reactions and distant spread, especially since Botox has no reason to travel to the rest of       the body any way. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Aim 1 over 6 months will demonstrate ASIS devices consistent performance on 60 adult       subjects with Upper limb Spasticity. Gadolinium will be injected with ASIS subdermally 30       or conventional intramuscularly 30 for these 7 muscle groups: Biceps Brachii, Flexor Carpi       Radialis, Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Digitorum Sublimis,       Adductor Pollicis, and Flexor Pollicis Longus. An MRI will be taken promptly after       Gadolinium injection, as starting reference, to which subsequent MRI taken at 6 hrs, 12 hrs,       and 24 hrs later will be compared for Persistent %. Since there isnt a way to measure level       of Gadolinium within it, or any other e.g. Botox for that matter, at least the       Prolongation of Gadolinium may be approximated by the greater or longer Persistent % on MRI.       However, this approximation can only work if the variables are minimized to the same       population with Upper limb Spasticity, and these particular 7 muscle groups. Case in point,       patients with Upper limb Spasticity presumably have hyperactivity in these 7 muscle groups,       so expectantly will have shortened Gadolinium intramuscularly Persistent %, and somewhat       reduced Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % as well due to agitation, thus these Persistent       % values in Upper limb Spasticity patients will not be like those of normal patients, or       even the same between these 7 different muscle groups. Therefore, the Relative Prolongation       Ability Score or total Persistent % subdermally over total Persistent % intramuscularly,       will be specific and valuable indicators to help us modify the Botox dosage and duration to       inject into that unknown subdermal bloodless space for Aim 2.        Aim 2 over 12 months, using Botox, instead of Gadolinium, to demonstrate the advantages of       ASIS device subdermally over intramuscularly, for the same 60 adult subjects with Upper limb       Spasticity, on these particular 7 muscle groups: Biceps Brachii, Flexor Carpi Radialis,       Flexor Carpi Ulnaris, Flexor Digitorum Profundus, Flexor Digitorum Sublimis, Adductor       Pollicis, and Flexor Pollicis Longus. Hypothetically speaking, if that subdermal bloodless       space in patients with e.g., Upper limb Spasticity somehow failed to show prolongation of       half-life for Gadolinium in Aim 1, we can still proceed with primary interest being       therapeutic comparison for Botox in Aim 2, in terms of improvement on the Physician Global       Assessment Scale and Ashworth score force required to move an extremity around a joint, at       6,12,18,24, and 30 weeks, and reduction in adverse reactions.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02097186","TITLE:       Preconditioning Shields Against Vascular Events in Surgery SUMMARY:       Major vascular surgery involves operations to repair swollen blood vessels, clear debris       from blocked arteries or bypass blocked blood vessels. Patients with these problems are a       high-risk surgical group as they have generalized blood vessel disease. These puts them at       risk of major complications around the time of surgery such as heart attacks , strokes and       death. The mortality following repair of a swollen main artery in the abdomen is about 1 in       20. This contrasts poorly with the 1 per 100 risk of death following a heart bypass. Simple       and cost-effective methods are needed to reduce the risks of major vascular surgery. Remote       ischaemic preconditioning RIPC may be such a technique. To induce RIPC, the blood supply       to muscle in the patients arm is interrupted for about 5 minutes. It is then restored for a       further five minutes. This cycle is repeated three more times. The blood supply is       interrupted simply by inflating a blood pressure cuff to maximum pressure. This repeated       brief interruption of the muscular blood supply sends signals to critical organs such as the       brain and heart, which are rendered temporarily resistant to damage from reduced blood       supply. Several small randomized clinical trials in patients undergoing different types of       major vascular surgery have demonstrated a potential benefit. This large, multi-centre trial       aims to determine whether RIPC can reduce complications in routine practice. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The demand for major vascular surgery is increasing [1]. Patients requiring procedures such       as aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, lower limb surgical re-vascularisation       and major lower limb amputation for end-stage vascular disease constitute a high-risk       surgical cohort. Peri-operative complications such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular       accident, renal failure and death are common [2,3]. Multiple potential mechanisms may result       in these complications. For example, myocardial injury may result from systemic hypotension       leading to reduced flow across a tight coronary artery stenosis or, alternatively, it may       arise due to acute occlusion when an unstable plaque ruptures. Most strategies aimed at       peri-operative risk reduction target a single potential mechanism. For example,       beta-blockade may prevent myocardial injury due to overwork, but cannot prevent acute       coronary occlusion. There is a requirement for a simple, effective intervention that       protects tissues against injury via multiple different mechanisms. Remote ischemic       preconditioning RIPC may be suitable.        Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon whereby a brief period of non-lethal ischemia in a       tissue renders it resistant to the effects of a subsequent much longer ischaemic insult. It       was first described in the canine heart [4]. Subsequent clinical trials showed that ischemic       preconditioning reduced heart muscle damage following coronary artery bypass grafting [5]       and liver dysfunction following hepatic resection [6]. Following cardiac surgery, it is       associated with a reduction in critical care stay, arrhythmias and inotrope use [7].       However, ischemic preconditioning requires direct interference with the target tissues       blood supply, limiting its clinical utility. Further experimental work suggested that brief       ischemia in one tissue, such as the kidneys, could confer protection on distant organs such       as the heart [8]. A similar effect was observed after transient skeletal muscle ischemia       [9-11]. This effect is referred to as preconditioning at a distance or remote ischemic       preconditioning RIPC.

The effects of increasing and decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP on chest       wall and total respiratory system mechanics, lung volumes and gas exchange will be       evaluated, both during controlled and assisted mechanical ventilation.        Patients will be studied, first, during the acute phase of respiratory failure, when       requiring intubation and controlled mechanical ventilation. Then, patients will be evaluated       again during weaning from the ventilator to assess the influence of PEEP in assisted       ventilation prior to extubation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The goal of this study is to describe the influence of the chest wall on the respiratory       system mechanics. Investigators want to describe how extreme obesity and Intra-Abdominal       Hypertension IAH affect normal respiratory system behavior. The effects of increasing and       decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP on respiratory system mechanics, lung       volumes and gas exchange will be evaluated, both during controlled and assisted mechanical       ventilation.        Investigators will record and compare lung volumes, airway and transpulmonary pressure, gas       exchange and hemodynamic changes caused by variations of PEEP. Patients will be studied,       first, during the acute phase of respiratory failure, when requiring intubation and       controlled mechanical ventilation. Patients will then again be evaluated during weaning from       the ventilator to assess the influence of PEEP in assisted ventilation prior to extubation.        Investigators believe that assessment of the transpulmonary pressure and lung volumes is       essential to correctly evaluate respiratory system function in patients in which the       relationship between the lung and chest wall is altered. Improper mechanical ventilation       leads to lung damage. High ventilatory volume/pressure are associated with lung       overdistension, while low volume/pressure leads to lung collapse and cyclic opening and       closing of alveoli. All of these mechanisms have been associated with ventilator induced       lung injury and poorer outcomes. Adequate PEEP and transpulmonary pressure are fundamental       in preventing this vicious cycle.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02122159","TITLE:       Research With Retinal Cells Derived From Stem Cells for Myopic Macular Degeneration SUMMARY:       Pathologic myopia is a major cause of legal blindness worldwide. In myopic macular       degeneration MMD, there is degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelial RPE layer, and       associated photoreceptors, resulting in vision loss. There is currently no standard       treatment for MMD.        Transplantation of intact sheets of RPE and suspensions of isolated individual RPE cells as       well as autologous translocation of RPE cells has been attempted as treatment for AMD. Human       photoreceptors are comprised of two cell types-rods and cones. Both have a close       relationship with the outermost retinal cells, the retinal pigmented epithelium RPE. The       RPE is located between the choroid and the photoreceptors. The RPE maintains photoreceptor       function by recycling photopigments,delivering, metabolizing and storing vitamin A,       phagocytosing rod photoreceptor outer segments, transporting iron and small molecules       between retina and choroid, maintaining Bruchs membrane and absorbing stray light to allow       better image resolution. In essence, the RPE layer is critical to the function and health of       photoreceptors and the retina as a whole.        Human PRE hRPE transplantation may be a viable option for treatment of degenerative       diseases of the retina.        MA09-hRPE cells are fully differentiated human RPE cells derived from embryonic stem cells.       Transplanted hRPE cells prepared by Advanced Cell Technology have been studied in rodent       models of macular degenerative disease. The data suggests that the subretinal injection of       ACTs hRPE cell products rescues, or at least delays, loss of visual function in two animal       models of retinal degenerative diseases.        The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MA09-hRPE       cellular therapy in patients with Myopic Macular Degeneration MMD. Another objective is to       evaluate potential efficacy endpoints to be used in future studies of RPE cellular therapy.

The annual incidence of HT worldwide is estimated to be 0.8       - 3.5 cases per 1000 persons. The thyroid gland attacked by a variety of cell- and       antibody-mediated immune processes. Various auto-antibodies may be present against TPO and       Tg, and ADCC is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of HT. Activation of       cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper       T-cells is central to thyrocyte destruction. Recent studies showed higher pro-inflammatory       cytokines in serum of patients with HT, and suggested HT is associated with regulatory       T-cells dysfunction, imbalance of ratio of Th1 cell and Th2 cell, overexpression of Th17       cells.        Several studies suggested that pregnant women with HT, even at euthyroid state had higher       risk of spontaneous miscarriage, more frequent post-partum depression and higher depressive,       anger, and total mood disturbance risk compared to those without HT. Presence of thyroid       auto-antibodies is also associated with negative pregnant outcomes including gestational       hypertension, late abortion, fetal death, premature delivery and neonatal respiratory       distress. Neonates from mothers with ATD have higher rate of transient hypothyroidism.       Children of mothers with ATD had higher risk of positive serum thyroid auto-antibodies and       development of goiter and thyroid dysfunction. However, there is no suggested treatment for       subjects with HT who have normal thyroid function. Low-iodine diet and regularly follow-up       were suggested.        Plaquenil hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malarial agent, and has been used to treat several       autoimmune diseases, including lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis for more than a       century. It reduced lymphocytes, production of auto-antibodies, cytokines, and immune       mediators, NK cell activity, and inhibits antigens presenting to CD4 T-cells of B cells,       dendritic cells and monocytes.        This study focuses on the effect of Plaquenil on thyroid auto-antibodies, inflammatory       markers, cytokines, and goiter size in euthyroid women with HT.

Women in the integrated risk reduction intervention will score significantly lower on            outcome measures of intimate partner abuse IPA and STD/HIV risk behaviors end of            Session III and at 3 and 6 months than women in the control group          2. Women in the integrated risk reduction Intervention will score significantly higher on            IPA safety behaviors and STI/HIV prevention behaviors at end of Session III and at 3            and 6 months than women in the control group.        Several exploratory and major controlled studies on the mainland US have shown intimate       partner violence IPV and intimate partner abuse IPA to be risk factors for a variety of       physical, reproductive and mental health problems, including sexually transmitted infections       and HIV/AIDS, many of which are areas of known health disparity for African American and       Latina women. A recently completed study of African Caribbean and African American women in       the US Virgin Islands revealed that nearly one third of women reported lifetime partner       abuse and increased risk for sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. Abused       women in the USVI had significantly more risk factors for HIV/AIDS than did women who were       not abused.        The proposed intervention combines an empowerment model designed to help abused women make       choices that protect the physical and emotional health of the woman and her family with a       sexual safety model designed to help her make choices to reduce her risk of acquiring an STI       or contracting HIV/AIDS. The integrated model adapts two interventions that have been tested       with African American women on the US mainland and found to be effective as separate       interventions for IPV and IPA and reducing the risk of STI/HIV. The adapted interventions       will be used with abused African Caribbean women based on an a priori assessment of the       cultural attitudes, beliefs and resources available to women living in an island environment       with limited resources. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       I. Background and Significance: Several exploratory and major controlled studies conducted       on the mainland US have shown intimate partner violence IPV or intimate partner abuse       IPA to be risk factors for a variety of physical, reproductive and mental health problems,       including HIV/AIDS, many of which are areas of known health disparity for African American       and Latina women.        The current investigators recently completed the first in-depth prevalence study of violence       and abuse of women in the US Virgin islands USVI and associated health consequences. This       seminal study showed 1 Lifetime prevalence of IPV of 32.8% in the USVI and past two year       prevalence of 37.2%%.in a sample of 1059 women aged 18-55 who self-identified as African       Caribbean or from African descent and who had an intimate partner during the past two years       2 Past two year physical and/or sexual abuse ranged from 4 % on the island of St Croix to       9% on St Thomas 3 Abused women had significantly more risk factors for Sexually Transmitted       Infections STIs and HIV/AIDS than did women not abused, and 4 Risk factors for STIs and       HIV/AIDS included being forced into vaginal or anal sex, women having concurrent partners or       their partners having multiple partners, having a STI, lack of consistent condom use, and       exchange sex trading sex for material goods This study also found women amenable to being       asked about IPV in health care settings where a brief intervention could be feasibly       implemented. Preliminary qualitative work illuminated womens perceptions of community and       cultural perspectives on IPV in the USVI. The proposed randomized clinical trial RCT       builds on findings from the prior study.        II. Research Strategy: A RCT will provide a preliminary test of an intervention designed to       reduce IPV and IPA and the concurrent risk of STIs and HIV in abused USVI women by       empowering their use of safety behaviors and increasing their use of resources... IPV and       IPA have been linked to high-risk sexual behaviors, the inability to negotiate safer sex       behaviors, and negative sexual health outcomes. The research plan is to deliver a structured       intervention to reduce the devastating impact of IPV and IPA for abused women in the USVI.        Time I: Women will respond to baseline data measures using computer assisted self-reports.       Data collected include socio-demographic and cultural characteristics of women and their       partners, past and recent intimate partner physical, sexual and emotional abuse SVAWS,       Danger Assessment DA, baseline HIV/STD status and risks for infection, including condom       use. To minimize attrition contact information for each participant and for three contact       persons family, friends, and neighbors will also be collected. Abused women will be       randomized by the computer to either the Healthy Relationships Risk Reduction experimental       intervention group or the Healthy Lifestyles comparison control group A. Session 1- Risk       Reduction Intervention Group. Women in the Experimental Intervention will complete this       session following initial assessment and group assignment. The ESP-DOVE IPV Empowerment       Intervention is an individualized 60 minute protocol following the initial enrollment       session. Abused women will view a video developed in the US Virgin Islands, using local       actors, depicting various experiences of abused Virgin Island. The abused women will       participate in a one on one structured, brochure-based intervention with a trained       interventionist that addresses information about the cycle of violence, risk factors that       may increase a womans danger of homicide the Danger Assessment, choices or options       leaving, using local shelter resources, accessing resources in the criminal justice       system, safety planning, and specific local and national phone numbers for IPV resources.       The intervention provides the woman with information, emphasizing that she has options or       The structured ESP- DOVE intervention is interactive and encourages the woman to describe       her experiences and choose her options as they proceed. The intervention has been modified       to be culturally appropriate for abused women of African Caribbean or African American       background living in the US Virgin Islands. Since the context of IPV varies considerably,       this approach allows individualization, client input and choice, all thought to enhance       intervention success with battered women and other hard to reach populations At the same       time, the brochure gives the nurse and other interventionists a script to increase       uniformity of the intervention across women and interventionists. Four major intervention       components: a IPV information, b Danger Assessment, c Safety Planning, and d Resources       are explored. At the end of Session I, the woman in the risk reduction intervention group       will provide contact information for Session 2 which will be scheduled one week later.        Time 2: Session 2- Women will assess their needs associated with IPV, safety behaviors and       feelings about how their situation is evolving. The need for resources and services will be       explored. The session will also focus on helping the women learn how to reduce their risk       for HIV/STD infections. This one-on-one behavioral intervention has been found to reduce       HIV/STD risk behaviors and STD morbidity among inner-city African American women in primary       care settings in a NINR funded randomized controlled trial. The intervention has been       modified and culturally tailored for abused women in the US Virgin Islands and involves a       skill-building one-on-one session that the facilitator tailors to the specific needs of each       participant after conducting an HIV/STD risk assessment interview. It involves STD       prevention behavioral skills, video clips, condom demonstration, practice with an anatomical       model, and role-playing. Curriculum activities are also designed to help women recognize       that faulty reasoning and decision-making can increase their risk of HIV infection. The       activities help the women understand the adverse consequences of participating in unsafe       sexual activity and the positive consequences of safer sexual practices. Contact information       for Session 3 will be validated and a follow up group session scheduled.        Time 3: Session 3: The third session will consist of small groups 8-10 of women in a       supportive/educational session led by an interventionist and investigator. Sessions held in       each district in the USVI and will be scheduled two weeks following Session 2. Women in the       experimental intervention group will have another opportunity to integrate issues related to       their IPV experiences. . They will interact with other abused women in a setting conducive       to sharing attitudes and beliefs about IPV prevention, cultural beliefs about IPV, the need       for support, assertiveness training, stress and affect management, safety enhancement       strategies and effective behaviors to reduce the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted       disease and personal vulnerability. Session three will be offered twice each week in each       district until all participants have had an opportunity to complete the intervention. At the       end of session 3, the women will be scheduled for a three month follow-up to assess       outcomes. Contact information will be reconfirmed.        B. Healthy Living Comparison Control Group Session 1: Women in the Healthy Living comparison       control group will complete the baseline assessment using the computer assisted tablets for       self-report. Women who report a history of intimate partner abuse will be will be yoked on       age >25 or <below 25 and ethnicity Hispanic or Non-Hispanic and education HS grad vs <       high school graduation. During Session one, if randomly assigned to the Healthy Living       Comparison Control intervention group, they will be focus on Breast Health Education and how       to develop a breast health care plan aimed at reducing the risk of breast cancer in women of       African heritage. Obesity as a risk factor for breast cancer will be introduced. Booklets on       breast health and developing a breast health plan will be provided as well as general       resource information on women and child health services. Contact information for the one       week follow up will be obtained and the woman given an appointment for Session II.        Session 2: At time two women in the comparison control health promotion group will be       involved in a session on Healthy Lifestyles for African Caribbean Women: Reducing Obesity       Risks. The one on one interactive session will discuss the association between breast cancer       and obesity as well as other major health problems associated with obesity. They learn how       to assess their Body Mass Index and measure waist conference to determine whether or not       they are at risk for obesity related health problems. The session will last approximately       one hour. They will also be briefly reassessed for abuse to determine if abuse is escalating       and the need for a referral. Participant contact information will be confirmed and Session 3       scheduled two weeks later.        Session 3: At time three participants in the comparison control health promotion group       control will engage in a follow up group session of 6-8 women that will include sharing       progress made on developing breast health plans as well as planned choices to reduce obesity       and promote healthy lifestyles including diet and exercise. The group discussion will be       facilitated by the original facilitator as well as one of the study investigators. Contact       information for the final follow up will be will be validated. Participants will complete a       post interview on the computer and a 3 month follow-up outcome assessment will be scheduled.        C. Outcome Measures Time 4: Intervention outcomes will be measured at three months to assess       effectiveness and safety of the Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention for Women       Experiencing IPA. Participants will include women who completed all three sessions of the       Risk Reduction intervention or three sessions of the Health Education Comparison Control       group. The outcome measures will be completed on computer tablets and will include the same       measures that were used at the initial assessment in addition to an assessment of changes in       safety and prevention behaviors. Participants will be scheduled for a six month follow-up       for final outcome measures.        Time 5: Final post intervention outcome measures will be obtained six months after the       participant completes the 3 month outcome measures. The women will again be contacted at       least two weeks prior to the scheduled outcomes measures by Caribbean Exploratory NIMHD       Research Center Staff to re-confirm the scheduled follow-up and will repeat the same process       on computer tablets including outcome measures used at the three month assessment.        D. Data management          1. Preliminary Analyses: Microsoft Access and Excel will be used for record keeping,            tracking, and initial data processing. The latest versions of SAS and SPSS computer            programs will be used for data management and analysis. Access to the computers and            data CDs will be limited both physically and electronically. Computers and data will be            stored in an office that is locked when not in use. Access to databases will be            restricted with read and write protection. Data analysis will begin with preparatory            activities such as the treatment of missing data, identification of outliers and other            such data cleaning tasks. A detailed descriptive analysis of all quantitative data will            be performed, involving the summarization of data and the use of inferential and            graphical exploratory data analytic techniques.          2. Analysis: To conduct a preliminary test of the integrated intervention as described in            the brief description, analysis of covariance, frequency and logistic regression will            be used to explore potential differences in predictor variables between the two groups.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02159625","TITLE:       Abdominal Compression Elastic Support ACES SUMMARY:       Hemodialysis HD patients with end stage renal disease ESRD experience higher rates of       cardiovascular CV morbidity and mortality than do the general population and many       populations with other chronic diseases. This exceptional risk is explained in part by known       risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, and other uremia-related factors, including       vascular calcification and stiffness, autonomic dysfunction, and a high burden of       circulating inflammatory mediators. Recent studies suggest that blood pressure variability,       especially intra-dialytic hypotension IDH is the most significant risk factor for these CV       events. Studies have also shown that the use of IAB is capable of improving cardiovascular       function for avoiding or minimizing the development of an orthostatic hypotensive episode       OHE in patients with autonomic dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension OH in diabetes       patients and children with orthostatic intolerance, and post-dialytic orthostatic       hypotension PDOH.        The investigators propose a study to examine the use of an abdominal compression elastic       support ACES to prevent the development of IDH in patients who are known to be prone to       these episodes. The ultimate goal is to facilitate more effective and safer dialysis       therapy. The ACES has a configuration that is similar to a back-support work belt or an       inflatable abdominal band IAB. All of these devices are wrapped around to compress the       abdomen at the waist. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       I. Study Design: Biomedical          1. Controls will be used. For the safety of ACES five healthy subjects will be used as            controls to assess the safety and tolerability of the device. The regular HD treatments            of each study patient will serve as their own control in assessing the effect of ACES            use on their HD treatments. The control data are derived from the treatment logs of            four to eight HD regular treatments taken by the patient.          2. The study design is an open trial.          3. No placebo is involved          4. This is a single center study to be done only at the Medical Center of University of            Virginia UVa.        II. Human Participants Ages: 18 or older Sex: Male and Female Race: All        Subjects or Patients:          1. 5 healthy subjects and 20 dialysis patients to complete protocol.          2. There could be a 50% drop out rate for the dialysis patients.          3. 30 Up to 5 healthy subjects and Up to 35 dialysis patients will be enrolled at all            sites          4. All 30 subjects and patients will sign a consent form under this protocol.          5. The estimated time line for the study is 100% enrollment within 10 months III.            Statistical Considerations          1. Is stratification/randomization involved? No          2. What are the statistical considerations for the protocol? In analyzing the data, if the            systolic blood pressure SBP of a given patient compared with the first blood pressure            reading after initiating dialysis is larger than the threshold 20 mmHg condition A or            the decrease in mean arterial pressure is larger than 10 mmHg and the development of            hypotensive symptoms condition B, this session hour will be identified as an IDH            session hour. The data may be divided into two groups one under condition A and one            under condition B for further analysis on the impact of the conditions on the            effectiveness of ACES.             In our study design, the countermeasure implemented in each control session may be            different. Our study can lead to an answer on whether the use of ACES is more effective            in alleviating IDH than the control countermeasure.             The researchers will only handle the quantitative data and the analysis of enumeration            and quantitative data. To assure integrity in and correctness of data analysis, all            data will be forwarded to a statistician who is not physically involved with the study            for an independent evaluation.          3. Provide a justification for the sample size used in this protocol.             A. On the safety issue: Due to the low compression pressure and no adverse effects seen            in the use of IAB, we expect that the investigators should not see the development of            any adverse effect in the current clinical trial. When the investigators carry out 40            ACES session in Phase II and show no adverse effect, then the likely hood for an            adverse effect to develop will be at most 2.5%. Even if the occurrence frequency were            at 25%, a sample size of 16 sessions will be more than adequate to demonstrate the            safety hypothesis with a confidence better than 99% i.e. P<0.01.             B. On the reduction in occurrence frequency. The patients participated in the study            will have at least 2 episodes in a month. It can add up to an occurrence frequency of            25%. This is to say that 20 out of the 80 control sessions will have IDH developed. If            the occurrence frequency is reduced to 12.5% i.e. 12 sessions with IDH out of the 80            ACES sessions, the data of 80 ACES session will be adequate to show a confidence level            of 99% by the chi square test P<0.01 that the use of ACES is effective in reducing            the occurrence frequency. On the other hand, if the frequency estimated from the data            of Phase II is reduced to 18% instead of 12.5%, then the data of 80 ACES sessions in            Phase II will yield a χ2 of about 2.0. With data of 80 more ACES sessions in Phase II,            the value of χ2 for the same decrease in occurrence frequency may increase to 4 to            indicate that the reduction in occurrence frequency has a confidence level of 95%            P<0.05.             The above computation analysis has been expanded to examine how test size and the            values of occurrence rate affect the value of χ2 and subsequently whether the            occurrence rate is significantly reduced with the use of ACES. The investigators find            that the three test sizes 80 tests mentioned here, 160 tests and 480 periods mentioned            later set for use in the protocol are adequate to carry out the statistical            determination.             Currently the investigators do not have a certain way to predict when IDH will develop.            Thus, the investigators consider each HD session done on the same patient as            independent.          4. The investigators have worked with a retired statistician in designing this protocol.        IV. Biomedical Research          1. Healthy subjects:             In order to fulfill the study statistical requirements, up to five 5 healthy subjects            will be tested for safety and tolerability of wearing ACES for 3 hours. Each healthy            individual will then wear the ACES for three consecutive hours in a supine or seated            position, except for use of the restroom if needed, and assess the measured parameters.             If no major concerns are identified with this healthy population the use of ACES device            will be offered for use in dialysis patients who have three or more episodes of IDH in            the 4 weeks leading up to recruitment.          2. Dialysis Patients             Hemodialysis patients at the University of Virginia Kidney Center have their            hemodialysis done in a seated position 30° to 90°. The investigators will be using            the ACES device on these patients in a seated position.             In order to fulfill the study statistical requirements, up to ten 10 ESRD patients on            HD will be tested for safety and tolerability of wearing ACES during their dialysis            sessions.             Screening trial session for Dialysis Patients After the patient reads and signs the            consent form and passes the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the investigators will            have him or her to undergo a trial session of ACES. This trial session can be done on            the same day as the consent form or it can be done on another day that the patient is            coming for a regular dialysis session. This trial session is designed to find out            whether the patient can tolerate the compression of the ACES and whether his/her SBP            and heart rate can be significantly altered by the compression. Over the course of this            screening trial, the patient will be advised that he can request removal of the ACES            whenever he/she wishes.          3. Control & ACES Sessions:             The patients will undergo a HD treatment as prescribed by their attending            nephrologists. The investigators expect that the characteristics of these treatments            will have the following general features:             • The HD setting can lead to a Kt/V larger than 1.2             • A procedure or countermeasure will have been prescribed and set up as standard of            care to deal with the development of IDH.               -  The measurement of blood pressure and heart rate will be performed by the usual                 dialysis machine for a given patient, providing internal equipment standardization               -  The blood pressure cuff will be applied to bare skin on the patients arm               -  The data obtained for eight regular HD treatments without wearing the ACES will be                 identified as the control data. For each patient, four HD treatment sessions will                 be conducted with the use of ACES in Phase II and four more will be done in Phase                 III if the data of Phase II calls for.             Preparation to start the hemodialysis with ACES             • Before the screening test of the patient, the investigators will get the waist            circumference of the patient. The size of the ACES is chosen from this specification:            22~27 56~68cm-Small, 28~33 71~84cm-Medium, 34~40 86~101cm-Large, 41~47            104~119cm-Extra-Large, 48~54 122~137cm-Extra-Extra-Large 55~61 140~155cm.             • Put on the ACES with its band tips already aligned with the white marking. At this            no load marking, the compression pressure imposed by the ACES is less than 2 mmHg.            This step is done before the patient is seated and attached to the blood lines.             • The HD treatment will start as usual.             During HD Control and ACES session if the patient experiences IDH or SBP drop If the            study investigators deem that the patient is experiencing symptoms of IDH or sees that            the SBP drops 20 mm Hg, then a charted course will be used on what countermeasures are            to be employed.             Post-dialytic care and data collection • Post dialytic procedure and care will include:             o Removal of the ACES and one more BP and pulse measurement,             o Discharge of the patient who is diagnosed as having no PDOH,             o Whether the patient is asked to come back for another HD treatment the next day,             o If the patient is classified as one with PDOH, the procedure to discharge the patient            as prescribed by the physician will be followed. If it is prescribed to take a standing            up test, it will be done with the ACES on. If the patient is to be sent home, then the            ACES will be taken off the patient and another standing up test be done. If the patient            is to be sent to an emergency center, then the physician will make a decision on            whether to send the patient with the ACES on or with it off.          4. Events calling for decompression of the ACES.        If the following complications develop while the ACES is in use the device will be removed •       A decrease in toe O2 saturation below 90%, • An increase in leg circumference by more than       10% to indicate leg edema,        • Pain or cramping in the abdominal area and/or lower extremities being more severe than the       norm          -  Vomiting more severe than the norm          -  Any other threatening complication          -  The patient requests removal of the device reason for request will be recorded        The study team will investigate whether the complications result from abdominal compression       imposed by the ACES. If ACES is deemed as the cause, then the ACES will be decompressed.       When the level of aspartate aminotransferase AST alanine aminotransferase ALT become       available to Global Monitor, Inc. and is found to be higher than the norm, then a       retrospective analysis will be made to determine whether the level increase relates to the       use of ACES.        V. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan An adverse event will be considered any undesirable sign,       symptom or medical or psychological condition even if the event is not considered to be       related to the investigational drug/device/intervention. Medical condition/diseases present       before starting the investigational drug/intervention will be considered adverse events only       if they worsen after starting study treatment/intervention. An adverse event is also any       undesirable and unintended effect of research occurring in human patients as a result of the       collection of identifiable private information under the research. Adverse events also       include any problems associated with the use of an investigational device that adversely       affects the rights, safety or welfare of patients.        The symptoms or disease developments described as the exclusion criteria i.e. beyond the       first six will be considered as adverse effect. The symptoms or excessive decrease in SBP,       for example, that are normally associated with hypotension development and are found to be       common in HD patients of UVa clinics will be reported but not considered as adverse event       and not used as a trigger to discontinue the ACES session.        The adverse event will be reported to FDA in a case report form.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02163031","TITLE:       Left vs. Right Radial Approach for Routine Catheterization of Heart Transplant Patients SUMMARY:       Orthotopic heart transplantation is a well established therapeutic measure for end stage       heart failure, leading to significant improvements in survival and quality of life. In the       routine clinical practice, orthotopic heart transplantation patients receive periodic       cardiac catheterization for early detection of allograft vascular disease.        The coronary angiography of these patients is characterized for several technical       difficulties, generally related to the presence of the aortotomy with anomalous implantation       of the coronary ostia and to the orthotopic position of the allograft. For these reasons,       trans femoral approach is usually preferred. In the last two decades, trans radial approach       for coronary angiography emerged to be effective, safe and able to improve patient comfort.       However, there is no universal consensus on the optimal choice of radial access from either       the left or the right artery. Currently, this choice is largely dependent on the operators       preference. The trans right radial approach is generally preferred in routine clinical       practice mainly due to its easier catheter manipulation for the operators from patients       right side, and the current design of radial compression devices for the right wrist in       medical market. As such, a major barrier to prevent the wide adoption of the left radial       access lies in some difficulty to reach the left wrist leaning over the patient,       particularly for shorter operators or in obese patients. However, a great deal of attention       has been recently directed toward the trans left radial access, as it has an important       anatomical advantage due to the vascular anatomy of epiaortic vessels with a straighter       route to the left coronary ostium, which could also reduce the risk of cerebrovascular       complications.        However, no data are available about the performance of trans left radial or trans-right       radial approach in coronary angiography orthotopic heart transplantation patients. However,       in this particular setting of patients, the left radial approach might reduce the technical       difficulties related to the anatomical variations.        In this single centre, prospective, randomized study, we sought to compare trans right       radial versus trans left radial approach in terms of amount of contrast medium, radiation       exposure, number of catheters used, cross over to the other access site rate and local and       systemic complications in orthotopic heart transplantation patients. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Orthotopic heart transplantation is a well established therapeutic measure for end stage       heart failure, leading to significant improvements in survival and quality of life.       Allograft vascular disease remains the most frequent cause of morbidity and mortality after       orthotopic heart transplantation, with angiographic evidence of allograft vascular disease       around 50% of patients at 5- to 15-year follow-up. In the routine clinical practice,       orthotopic heart transplantation patients receive periodic cardiac catheterization for early       detection of allograft vascular disease.        The coronary angiography of these patients is characterized for several technical       difficulties, generally related to the presence of the aortotomy with anomalous implantation       of the coronary ostia and to the orthotopic position of the allograft. For these reasons,       trans femoral approach is usually preferred. In the last two decades, trans radial approach       for coronary angiography emerged to be effective, safe and able to improve patient comfort.       However, there is no universal consensus about the optimal choice of radial access from       either the left or the right artery. Currently, this choice is largely dependent on the       operators preference. The trans-right-radial approach is generally preferred in routine       clinical practice mainly due to its easier catheter manipulation for the operators from       patients right side, and the current design of radial compression devices for the right       wrist in medical market. As such, a major barrier to prevent the wide adoption of the left       radial access lies in some difficulty to reach the left wrist leaning over the patient,       particularly for shorter operators or in obese patients. However, a great deal of attention       has been recently directed toward the trans-left-radial access, as it has an important       anatomical advantage due to the vascular anatomy of epiaortic vessels with a straighter       route to the left coronary ostium, which could also reduce the risk of cerebrovascular       complications.        In this context, a recent metanalysis demonstrated that trans left radial access is       preferable to trans-right-radial approach in terms of fluoroscopy time and contrast use for       the diagnostic or interventional coronary procedures. Moreover, as expected, there was an       indication of lowered failure rate of radial access from the left than the right. No data       are available about the performance of trans left radial access or trans right radial       approach in coronary angiography of orthotopic heart transplantation patients. However, in       this particular setting of patients, the trans-left-radial access might reduce the technical       difficulties related to the anatomical variations.        In this single-centre, prospective, randomized study, we sought to compare trans right       radial approach versus trans-left-radial access in terms of amount of contrast medium,       radiation exposure, number of catheters used, cross-over to the other access site rate and       local and systemic complications in orthotopic heart transplantation patients.        Study objectives          1. To demonstrate the superiority of trans left radial access, compared to trans right            radial approach during coronary angiography of orthotopic heart transplantation            patients, in terms of amount of contrast medium, radiation exposure, number of            catheters used, cross-over to other access site rate local and systemic complications          2. To determine the relationship of operator experience with radiation exposure to answer            the question that whether we can minimize fluoroscopy time with increased operator            experience post-hoc analysis;          3. To assess the cost effectiveness of coronary angiography performed by trans right            radial approach versus trans left radial access post hoc analysis.        Method section Clinical data A detailed anamnesis of each trial participant will be       collected: age, gender, weight, high, BMI, coronary risk factors hypertension, dyslipemia,       diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity, cause of transplantation, date of       transplantation, current clinical status and therapy, ejection fraction, renal function and       complete blood count. In particular, creatinine values will be evaluated at baseline, 3-4       days after the interventional procedure and, if impaired, also at 7-10 days from the       coronary angiography.        Procedure Participating interventional cardiologists will be high-volume radial operators       meeting minimal proficiency criteria of ≥50% interventional cases by radial approach per       year. Each variable will be analyzed separately in consultants, fellows, and post graduate       fellows trainees. In particular, participating interventional cardiologists will be       divided in well experienced radial operators defined as the person who has performed >500       radial procedures including >200 procedures in a recent year, less experienced the person       who has done 200-500 radial procedures in a recent year, and trainee the person who has       done <200 radial procedures. The procedures will be performed according to current       guidelines. At the end of the coronary angiography, after introducer removal, a hand wrist       compression device TR Band, Terumo will be used in the both group.        The procedural time was measured from the arterial puncture up to vascular hemostasis.        The radiation exposure will be measured using:          1. dose area product meters, which reflects both the dose of radiation administered and            the area on the patient it is administered to. This is a continuous variable measured            in microgray meter squared μGym2.          2. fluoroscopy time, which reflects the length of time the patient and operator are            exposed to radiation;          3. total dose, measured in milligray mGy, administered from the angiography system.        The amount of contrast medium for each procedure will be recorded. The number and type of       catheters employed as well as the number and the type of wires used in the interventional       procedure will be detected.        The cross-over to other access site were also collected. In addition, systemic and vascular       complications will be evaluated pre-discharge.        In particular, vascular complications will be defined as haemoglobin loss at least 2 mmol/l,       necessity of a blood transfusion and vascular repair, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm and arterial       occlusion. The renal failure after procedure will be defined as a raise in serum values of       creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl or ≥ 25% within 24-72 hours after the exposure to the contrast       medium.        Statistical Analysis        All clinical and procedural characteristics will be summarized as mean ± Standard Deviation       for continuous variables with normal distribution, median interquartile range for those       continuous but with skewed distribution, and number percentage for categorical variables;       The Student t, Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests will be computed when appropriate for       bivariate analyses. Firstly, all analyses will be conducted on intention to treat basis,       regardless possible access site cross-over. Afterwards, efficacy subset analyses will be       performed. A two-tailed p-value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Data       will be analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 20.0 software SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA. The       sample size will be calculated in order to provide, with a 80% power, the difference of 20       ml with a Standard Deviation of ± 30 of amount of contrast dose alpha value=0.05 between       trans-left-radial access vs. trans-right-radial access. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria: eligible transplanted patients scheduled for a routine coronary         angiography with age >18 years old.          Exclusion Criteria:            1. chronic renal insufficiency creatinine >2.0 mg/dl with the potential necessity of              using the radial artery as a native fistula will be considered one of the exclusion              criteria;            2. in case of an abnormal or doubtful bilateral Allens test, a pletysmography will be              done. The presence of a type A or B curve will be considered a marker of adequate              hand collaterals and the procedure will be able by this access. Only the presence of              bilateral type C or D curves will be considered a contraindication to trans radial              approach. ");

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02172625","TITLE:       The Effect of Protandim Supplementation on Oxidative Damage and Athletic Performance SUMMARY:       Nutrition supplementation with antioxidants have been discussed as a way to further enhance       overall well-being of athletes, promote faster recovery, and improve overall performance.       The use of Protandim, a nutritional supplement containing 5 botanicals Bacoba extract 150       mg; milk thistle 225mg; ashwaganda 150 mg; green tea 75 mg; turmeric 75 mg has shown       promise in an earlier study by reducing oxidative stress and increasing the amount of the       anti-oxidant enzymes in the blood.        The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of ~90 day Protandim supplementation on       5-km running performance and on acute and long term oxidative damage as assessed by blood       markers. Secondarily, another purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Protandim       supplementation on measures of measures of quality of life. The experiment will be       double-blind, placebo controlled. The study will address four specific research questions:          1. Does regular supplementation of Protandim 675 mg/day for 90 days reduce oxidative            damage at rest as assessed by lipid peroxides TBARS in runners? Hypothesis: Based on            the data by Nelson et al. 2006, oxidative damaged will be reduced by 40% effect size            = 4.8          2. Does regular supplementation of Protandim 675 mg/day for 90 days in runners reduce            the increase in oxidative damage post-race compared to pre-race as assessed by lipid            peroxides TBARS? Hypothesis: Based on the data by Kyparos et al. 2009, we expect a            45% increase in TBARS post-exercise compared to pre-exercise effect size of 3.6.            However, we expect that those that are on Protandim for 90 days will only have 31%            increase in TBARS post-race effect size = 2.5 [based on changes in pre-post lipid            peroxides from Arent et al. 2010]          3. Does regular supplementation of Protandim 675 mg/day for 90 days improve 5-km running            times? Hypothesis: Protandim will improve 5-km running time by 0.5 min SD 1-min. This            is equivalent to an effect size of 0.5. The placebo group will have no change in            performance.          4. Does regular supplementation of Protandim 675 mg/day for 90 days improve either the            physical or mental component of quality of life according to the physical and            psychological component of the WHOQOL-BREF Skevington, Lotfy, OConnell, & Group,            2004? Hypothesis: There will be a statistical improvement in the quality of life            post-Protandim supplementation which a small effect size improvement of 0.33. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       A total of forty apparently healthy community runners 18 to 55 yrs of age will be recruited       to participate in this study that will require approximately six total visits to the       University of Louisville lab at Crawford gym, which includes three sessions at the running       track or cardio-path at University of Louisville.        A total of about 24 teaspoons of blood ∼120 mL, or about 2 to 3% of total blood volume       will be withdrawn from a peripheral vein for the duration of the study about 105 days.       Runners will be recruited from running clubs across the local community. Recruitment flyers       will be posted in running stores all over the city and through the daily University of       Louisville e-mail blasts, Facebook and other social media. These participants will be       randomized into two groups Protandim, Placebo. The groups will be sex and performance       matched after the initial 5-km race is run.        Each subject will undergo six testing sessions.        Session 1 Initial Screening Day        Subjects will sign a consent form and then they will complete a physical activity readiness       questionnaire PARQ to clear them for physical activity. Age, weight, and height will be       recorded. Subjects will be asked to list all the nutritional supplements they are taking,       including multivitamins. They will also be asked to list the 5-km personal best time, and       when that was done. They will also report most recent 5-km time and when that was achieved.       Then, they will be asked to refrain from taking any multivitamins or nutritional supplements       for the duration of the study due to the previous evidence that Vitamin E and C       supplementation affects plasma TBARS. The subjects will record what they eat during the 24       hr prior to the test day, and then ask them to eat the same thing and do same activity       before the all follow up tests. Then a training diary will be given to them to fill in for       the duration of the study. The training diary will include intensity, training duration, and       mileage per week. After, they will be given six quality of life questionnaires [World Health       Organizations WHOQOL-BREF quality of life assessment to fill out at home one each for       Session 1-6]. A pregnancy test will also be conducted in the females.        Session 2 Baseline, About 15 days after Session 1        Subjects will be fasted in the morning when they will arrive at University of Louisville for       their pre-exercise blood sampling. They will bring their 24-hr dietary recall with them and       their quality of life forms. Approximately three teaspoons of blood will be withdrawn 30-60       minutes prior to exercise for analysis of several blood parameters. Then subjects will be       required to partake in a 5-km time trial at the University of Louisville track or on the       University of Louisville Cardio-path. The runners will race together in groups of 6 to 10       runners per race according to their estimated 5-km time. The estimated 5-km time is their       own best estimate. Time trials have greater logical validity compared to time-to-exhaustion       tests Jeukendrup & Currell, 2005 so that is why time-trials are selected as the       performance measure.        About 30-minutes post-exercise, another three teaspoons of blood will be withdrawn from each       subject. Only after their post-exercise blood draw will the subjects be able to eat.        Based on the performance of the 5-km time trials, males and females will be ranked       separately. This will be done in randomized blocks of two. Randomized blocks of two for       males, and then randomized blocks of two for females. For example, 20 males will be ranked       from the 5-km race from 1st fastest runner to 20th slowest runner. First and second       place males will be a block of two. Third and fourth place males will be a block of two. And       so on. Then a fair coin will be flipped. If heads, the first ranked runner in the first pair       will go to Group 1, otherwise, the second ranked runner in the pair will go to Group 1. This       done for each block of two males each pair of two males. The same is then performed for       the 20 women. Twenty females will be ranked from first to 20th. First and second place       females will be the first block of two. Third and fourth place females will be the second       block of two. Then a fair coin will be flipped. If heads, the first ranked runner in the       first female pair will go to Group 1, otherwise, the second ranked runner in the female pair       will go to Group 1. And so one. This randomization should allow for the same mean 5-km       running times in each group as well as maintaining similar male to female ratios.        Session 3 About 7 days after Session 2        Subjects will be fasted in the morning when they will arrive at University of Louisville for       their pre-exercise blood sampling. They will bring their 24-hr dietary recall with them and       their quality of life forms. Approximately three teaspoons of blood will be withdrawn 30-60       minutes prior to exercise for analysis of several blood parameters the analytes are listed       in Table 3. Then subject will be required to partake in a 5-km time trial at the University       of Louisville track or on the University of Louisville Cardio-path.        About 30-minutes post-exercise, another three teaspoons of blood will be withdrawn from each       subject. Only after their post-exercise blood draw will the subjects be able to eat.        Depending on the Group, they will be given approximately 100 day supply of Protandim or       Placebo corn starch and food coloring. The study is double blinded so neither the       researchers nor the subjects will know which group is the Protandim group and which group is       the Placebo group. They will be asked to ingest 1 pill per day, ideally with breakfast 675       mg per day, 1 pill per day. The subjects will be given the complete supply of pills during       this session, right after the second blood sample is taken. The subjects will be classified       as Group 1 or Group 2 based on their five kilometer results from the first session. The pill       bottles will be labeled Group 1 or Group 2. The pill bottles will be dispensed by the       research team according to group number after their second blood sample. Subjects will be       ask to record the daily intake of the pills in their training diary. Once the study is       completed, subjects will be asked to return the pill bottles to the research staff. That       way, the researchers are able to account for any missed days.        Session 4 About 23 Days after Session 3        Subjects will be fasted in the morning when they will arrive at University of Louisville for       their pre-exercise blood sampling. They will bring their 24-hr dietary recall with them and       their quality of life forms. Approximately three teaspoons of blood will be withdrawn. There       will be no 5-km running race performed in this session. A pregnancy test will be performed       in the females.        Session 5 about 30 Days after Session 4        Subjects will be fasted in the morning when they will arrive at University of Louisville for       their pre-exercise blood sampling. They will bring their 24-hr dietary recall with them and       their quality of life forms. Approximately three teaspoons of blood will be withdrawn. There       will be no running race performed in this session. A pregnancy test will be conducted in the       females.        Session 6 About 30 days after Session 5        Subjects will be fasted in the morning when they will arrive at University of Louisville for       their pre-exercise blood sampling. They will bring their 24-hr dietary recall with them and       their quality of life forms. They will also bring any unused pills for proper documentation.       A pregnancy test will be conducted in the females. then, approximately three teaspoons of       blood will be withdrawn 30-60 minutes prior to exercise for analysis of several blood       parameters. Then subject will be required to partake in a 5-km time trial at the University       of Louisville track or on the University of Louisville Cardio-path.        About 30-minutes post-exercise, another three teaspoons of blood will be withdrawn from each       subject. Only after their post-exercise blood draw will the subjects be able to eat.        Things to Consider        The between subject-variability in oxidative stress biomarkers is large Mullins et al.       2013 and suggests that there may be responders and non-responders to an oxidative stress       challenge Mullins et al. 2013. Individuals who have large increases in oxidative stress       i.e. responders could be reflecting an inability to regulate redox homeostasis and warrant       additional support i.e. with antioxidant supplementation with Protandim. It is also       necessary to obtain week-to week and month to month coefficient of variation in markers of       oxidative stress so that meaningful changes in these markers can be evaluated. Thus, the       placebo group will be allow us to obtain the week-to-week and month to month coefficient of       variation. As well, for the same reason, it is necessary to obtain week-to-week and month to       month variation in running performance, thus, the placebo group will allow for the       development of the coefficient of variation in performance.        Measuring dietary data is troublesome. First, questionnaires dont give details about       antioxidant intake - rather they give outcomes like fruit and veg intake, etc. More in depth       measures wouldnt be worth the trouble. Thus, having subjects record what they eat and       their physical activity during the 24 hr prior to the test day, and then ask them to eat       the same thing and do same activity before the follow up tests at seven days and 90 days       will be required.        Environmental conditions will be recorded on the days of the three time trials wind,       temperature, % humidity, barometric pressure. Once all the data is collected, and the blood       results are in, LifeVantage will reveal which group was which.        Statistical Analyses        Once all the data is collected and analyzed, the LifeVantage will reveal which group was       which. The main dependent variables measured will be 5-km finishing time, TBARS, SOD, and       both the physical and mental/psychological component of the quality of life questionnaire.       Based on a 5-km time improvement of 2.5% or about 30 seconds SD = 1 minute with Protandim,       and no improvement in the placebo group, about 32 runners in total will be needed Effect       size = 0.5, statistical power = 80%, alpha error probability = 5%, Correlation amongst       repeated measures = 0.90, F-test Family, ANOVA repeated measures, between factors, G*Power       3.1.2, Universität Kiel, Germany. Accounting for a 20% attrition rate 8 subjects, a total       of 40 subjects will be recruited 20 per group.        Possible Risks of Ingesting Protandim        We do not expect there to be any side effects for the typical Protandim consumer. However,       according to the Protandim website http://www.protandim.com/faqs, some individuals have       natural allergic responses to one or another of the ingredients, just as some people are       allergic to pine pollen or penicillin. These allergic responses to Protandim generally       appear as gastrointestinal disturbances i.e., stomach ache, diarrhea, vomiting or       sometimes as a headache or rash on the hands or feet. The symptoms disappear if Protandim is       discontinued.        However, according to the Natural Standard Database       https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/, each botanical has been shown to have       rare side effects. They are listed on the next page grouped with each botanical.        MILK THISTLE: According to the Natural Standard Database, the 225 mg dose of Milk thistle       that is in each Protandim pill is likely safe. However, there are some rare side effects       that may occur. Milk thistle may cause allergic skin reactions, bloating, blood clots,       collapse, constipation, decreased platelets, diarrhea, eczema, elevated liver enzymes,       fever, gas, giddiness, headache, heart attack, heartburn, high bilirubin a toxic substance       in the blood, hives, impotence, increased creatinine, increased lactate dehydrogenase level,       infection, insomnia, irritability, itching, joint pain, liver damage, loss of appetite,       nausea, non-specific muscle and joint effects, pounding heart, rash, severe allergic       reactions, sexual dysfunction, stomach distress or pain, skin pigment lightening, skin       reactions, sweating, taste changes, tremor, vomiting, and weakness. Milk thistle may lower       blood sugar levels.        BACOPA EXTRACT: According to the Natural Standard Database, the 150 mg dose of Bacopa       extract that is in each Protandim pill is likely safe. However, there are some rare side       effects that may occur include nausea, dry mouth, thirst, and fatigue. Bacopa has been       reported to cause palpitations irregular heartbeats.        ASHWAGANDHA: According to the Natural Standard Database, the 150 mg dose of ashwagandha that       is in each Protandim pill is likely safe. However, there are some rare side effects that may       occur. Side effects of ashwagandha include the risk of bleeding, promote low blood sugar       levels, promote low blood pressure, and may cause drowsiness.        TURMERIC: According to the Natural Standard Database, the 75 mg dose of turmeric that is in       each Protandim pill is likely safe. However, there are some rare side effects that may       occur. Side effects of turmeric include an altered heartbeat, an increase in blood volume,       an increase in menstruation period, an increase in urine flow, changes in skin color,       changes in cholesterol decrease bad cholesterol, changes in immune function, changes in       thyroid function, common cold, constipation, decrease in fertility decrease sperm counts,       decrease in iron absorption, delusion, diarrhea, gallbladder contraction, gas, giddiness,       gout pain, hair loss high doses, heartburn, hormone changes, inflammation of stomach and       intestine lining, irritated or itchy skin, kidney stones, liver cell toxicity, liver       function changes, mild fever, oxidative stress, nausea, rash, skin hardness, skin papules,       skin redness, stomach fullness and pain, stomach ulcers, throat infection, transient       complete atrioventricular block a heart measurement, uterine contractions, vertigo, weight       loss, worsening of arthritis symptoms, and yellow or hard stools. Turmeric may increase the       risk of bleeding. Turmeric may lower blood sugar levels and blood pressure.

Haemorrhage Simulation Protocol in Healthy Volunteers SUMMARY:       In prehospital settings, hypovolemic shock diagnosis is based on Advanced Trauma Life       Support ATLS shock classification. The most often used clinical signs are heart rate HR,       arterial blood pressure BP, respiratory rate, neurologic status, diuresis, skin colour and       temperature. However, some of these signs, such as hypotension and tachycardia, lack       specificity and sensitivity and do not occur early enough. Even with an early preload       reduction, blood pressure can remain constant due to compensatory mechanisms, such as       vasoconstriction and positive chronotropism. Tachycardia occurs earlier, but has poor       specificity and sensitivity. A retrospective analysis of 25,287 trauma patients showed that       among 489 patients presenting with systolic BP < 90 mmHg, only 65% had tachycardia HR > 90       bpm, while 39% of patients with systolic BP > 120 mmHg were tachycardic, probably resulting       from other stimuli influencing heart rate, such as pain, fear, circulating hormones and       endogenous enkephalins. Therefore, it could be very useful to have an index that identifies       initial volume variation, when physiological regulatory mechanisms are still effectively       maintaining normal BP.        Pulse transit time PTT is the sum of pre-ejection period PEP; the time interval between       the onset of ventricular depolarization and ventricular ejection and vascular transit time       VTT; the time it takes for the pulse wave to travel from the aortic valve to peripheral       arteries. PEP and VTT variations depend on preload variation, and PTT increases with PEP,       showing a linear correlation R2 = 0.96. Chan et al. subjected 11 healthy volunteers to the       head-up tilt test, and demonstrated that PEP increased and VTT decreased for increasing tilt       angles from 0° to 80°, corresponding to light-moderate bleeding. They also observed early       sympathetic activation, expressed by decreases of both RR interval RR and VTT, dampening       the PTT increase, since PTT is influenced by both continuous PEP increase and progressive       VTT decrease occurring during hypovolaemia.        Here the investigators describe a new index, called indexed Heart to Arm Time iHAT. iHAT       is the mPTT/RR ratio, where mPTT is a modified PTT, measured from the onset of ventricular       depolarization the R wave of the ECG trace to the systolic peak of the       photoplethysmographic pulse oxymetry PPG waveform. mPTT is indexed to RR interval on ECG       to counteract sympathetic activation that would dampen PEP increase and enhance VTT       reduction, by means of positive inotropism and peripheral vasoconstriction, respectively.       iHAT therefore increases during haemorrhage because of preload reduction and the consequent       PEP increase and RR interval decrease. iHAT is expressed as the time percentage of the       interbeat interval RR it takes to the PPG waveform to travel to peripheral arteries. In       this study iHAT has been calculated as the average of beat-to-beat mPTT/RR ratios over 30       heart beats corresponding to at least 2 breathing cycles in order to minimize the effect       of spontaneous breathing on preload, and thus on PEP and PTT.        In the present study, the investigators aimed to evaluate iHAT in a simulating model of       hypovolaemia by using a Lower Body Negative Pressure LBNP chamber. LBNP chamber simulates       haemorrhage by applying negative pressure to the lower limbs, thus giving an accurate model       of hypovolemia. The LBNP chamber has been used for many years for research purposes, and in       2001 Convertino suggested it is a useful device to test severe haemorrhage-related       hemodynamic responses. In fact, the induced volemic sequestration is an efficient technique       to study physiological behaviours in humans.        The primary endpoint was to evaluate the use of the iHAT as a predictor of hypovolaemia. The       secondary endpoint was to compare the specificity and sensitivity of the iHAT index compared       to commonly used indexes BP, HR. Furthermore, the investigators aimed to assess       feasibility of Transthoracic echocardiography TTE evaluation of Cardiac Output CO in a       haemorrhagic model and to evaluate CO changes with respect to measured hemodynamic       variables.        TTE evaluation of CO is non invasive and comparable to thermodilution, and of possible use       in an emergency setting.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The aim of the study is to determine whether medical assistants MAs can assist primary       care providers to achieve healthier lifestyles via better sleep, food choices, weight loss       and/or increased physical activity in their patients. The hypothesis driving this research       is that health coaching can be done by existing medical support staff to facilitate healthy       lifestyles in a primary care setting. Coaching can maximize the health of the patient       population in a cost-effective way if the coaching service is integrated into primary care       clinics with minimal capital investment at the outset. A major focus will be on behaviors       associated with weight management since this is the most common health issue in the U.S.       today. This method, if successful, should be easily adaptable to other health behaviors and       in most any medical practice that seeks to improve the health of its patient base in a       cost-effective way.        In order to achieve a change in health behaviors, and especially weight loss, regular       follow-up contacts are needed. Previous research has shown health coaching to be effective,       but this has utilized programs that add on to the existing clinic structure. This type of       coaching model is difficult to sustain. Utilizing existing staff for health coaching is a       method we propose to more fully integrate this service into primary care clinics. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  adults age 21 and over            -  referred by primary care physician for health coaching            -  have telephone for follow-up            -  English speaking          Exclusion Criteria:            -  pregnant or trying to become pregnant ");

This study will look at the       effect of Ethinyl Estradiol 35mcg/Norethindrone 1mg and Ethinyl Estradiol 20       mcg/Norethindrone 1mg on postpartum depressive symptoms and sexual function scores when       compared to a control group using no hormonal contraception. Depressive symptoms and sexual       function will be measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale EPDS, Arizona       Sexual Experiences Scale ASEX, and Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women BISF-W.       Participants will begin taking the medication at Week 3 postpartum, and these outcomes will       be measured at baseline 0-1 day postpartum, Week 3, and Week 6-7. The investigators       hypothesize that there will be an ethinyl estradiol dose related response in EPDS, ASEX, and       BISF-W scores at Week 6-7, which would indicate a decrease in depressive symptoms and       increase in sexual function in both of the oral contraceptive groups.

Our research       hypotheses are: 1 regional anesthesia may contribute to decrease the incidence of       postoperative delirium. 2 Regional anesthesia may improve the outcome of elderly patient       and reduce healthcare costs associated with postoperative delirium. 3 Postoperative       delirium may result in poor long-term functional outcomes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Postoperative delirium POD is an acute confusional state associated with changes in       consciousness, arousal level and cognitive status. Elderly patients with hip fractures have       the high incidence of delirium. The high risk factor of delirium include: Age 65 years or       older, cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture, severe illness and so on. Many       previous studies predict that the majority of general anesthetic and sedative agents can       favour postoperative delirium. However, none of studies have investigated the effect of       general anesthesia and the effect of regional anesthesia and general anesthesia on the       postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery in China. This       multicentre, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to evaluate       postoperative delirium after general anesthesia and regional anesthesia in elderly patients       undergoing hip fracture surgery. Our research hypotheses are: 1 regional anesthesia may       contribute to decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. 2 Regional anesthesia may       improve the outcome of elderly patient and reduce healthcare costs associated with       postoperative delirium. 3 Postoperative delirium may result in poor long-term functional       outcomes.        This trial has the following nine investigational centers: Department of Anesthesiology, The       Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children hospital of Wenzhou Medical University,       Wenzhou, China; Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical college,       Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Anesthesiology,       West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China; Department of Anesthesiology,       Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, China; Department of Anesthesiology, The Second Affiliated       Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China; Department of       Anesthesiology, Beijing Jishuitan Hospital, Beijing, China; Department of Anesthesiology,       The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Department of       Anesthesiology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Anhui, China; The First       Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China;        Eligible patients will be assigned into two study groups group RA: regional anesthesia will       be used, group GA: General anesthesia will be used by centre-minimization randomization       web or telephone. There are 3 stratification factors: age 65-79,≥80, presence of       deliriumyes, no, dementiayes, no. There will be two teams of investigators involved in       trial procedure and the patients follow-up. Investigator A experienced anesthetist, who       are competent in caring for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, will perform following       works, which includes informed consent, randomization, anesthesia and recovery parameters.       Investigator B will visit patient the day before surgery and 7days after surgery or until       discharge to assess patient for presence, type and severity of delirium, collect other data       during in hospital stay and follow up patients at 6 and 12 months. Investigator B will       receive uniform training of using of CAM, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 DRS-R-98, MMSE       and other test used in this trial and will be not clear about protocol.        Within 24 h before surgery, cognitive function of each patient will be assessed with the       MMSE, the presence of delirium will be diagnosed with the CAM, the type and severity of       delirium will be assessed with DRS-R-98 and the pain will be assessed with a 100-mm visual       analog scale VAS. Routine monitoring NBP, continuous ECG, and pulse oximetry was       initiated on all patients. Premedication for anesthesia will be avoided before surgery. Any       medication impairing cognitive function will not be recommended, if administered, must be       recorded it in detail.        Investigator A will allocated the patient into group GA or group RA according the       centre-randomization with a unique registration number for each eligible patient. Treatment       protocols for both groups will also stipulate no sedative be administrated during operation.       Routine monitoring was initiated on all patients. Hypotension Systolic Blood       Pressure<90mmHg or drop of Mean Arterial Pressure>30% should be treated with vasoactive       agents or fluid boluses as deemed appropriate by anesthetists.        Postoperative analgesia will be administered according to the local procedures of each       clinical trial site, aiming to maintain a VAS pain score ≤ 30 mm. Both groups will receive       routine postoperative care on orthopedic ward.        All randomized patients will be followed up to 7 days after surgery or discharge from the       hospital. The 7 days follow-up includes: CAM, DRS-98-R if applicable, VAS, Analgesic use       if applicable, Sedative use if applicable, Post-operative morbidity and laboratory       results including serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, leucocytes, aspartate aminotransferase       AST, alanine aminotransferase ALT, albumin, serum creatinine and urea concentrations,       serum sodium and potassium and serum glucose concentration. Concomitant medications,       adverse events and serious adverse events are record in all study visits. Economic       parameters include: time to be discharged from post operation, total cost in hospital and       cost for anesthesia of patient. Investigator B will also assess patient with POD in clinic       or at their residence at 6 and 12 months to assess for presence of delirium, its type and       severity CAM, DRS-98-R, cognitive function using MMSE, and quality of life using The MOS       36-item Short-Form Health Survey SF-36 questionnaire.

Femoral compression       devices have been developed thorough the past decades without being strongly implemented in       the catheterization laboratory. Their limited adoption reflects concerns of high cost and       conflicting data regarding their safety DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The intra-arterial sheaths were removed 6 hours after PCI in the MC group according to the       standard local protocols. However for AFCD group, the sheaths were removed 2 hours after PCI       instead of conventional 6 hours. To standardize compression times, AFCD were applied to       patient and complete femoral artery compression were applied for 5 minutes, followed by a       gradual release of pressure till distal pulse is palpated. Each patient received a minimum       of 13 minutes of compression, with further compression applied only if full hemostasis had       not been achieved at that point with maximum of 30 minutes.

Prospective, Randomized Trial SUMMARY:       HYPOTHESIS          1. HAL- RAR causes a lower immediate postoperative pain compared with erxcision            hemorrhoidectomy.          2. HAL - RAR achieves similar immediate and long term results compared to the excision            hemorrhoidectomy in the control of hemorrhoidal symptoms.          3. The complication rate of HAL- RAR is low and similar to excision hemorrhoidectomy.        OBJECTIVES          1. Compare postoperative pain of both techniques.          2. Assess the short and long-term control of hemorrhoidal symptoms by HAL- RAR technique,            and compare the results with those of the excision hemorrhoidectomy.          3. Evaluate and compare the rate of complications of both techniques.          4. Assess the quality of life of patients before and after treatment.        MATERIAL AND METHODS        The trial was subjected to evaluation and accepted by the Ethics Committee of the Fundació       Unió Catalana dHospitals Catalonian Union of Hospitals Foundation.        All patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids that are eligible for surgical treatment with       both methods who agree to participate in the study, will be included in the prospective       randomized trial. All patients will be required to sign the specific informed consent.        Patients who are suitable for treatment with both techniques will be randomly assigned to       the surgical technique.        Inclusion criteria:        1. Patients with symptomatic grade III or IV hemorrhoids bleeding, pain, itching, soiling       or prolapse that are eligible for surgical treatment with both methods.        Exclusion criteria:          1. Associated recto-anal pathology such as acute thrombosed hemorrhoid, anal fissure,            perianal fistula, perianal abscess, rectal prolapse, fecal incontinence or anal            stenosis.          2. Prior anorectal surgery .          3. Systemic pathology that could alter the outcome of the surgery as coagulopathies,            chronic pain with continued consumption of analgesics.          4. Age younger than 18 or older than 80 years, socio-pathology or inability to understand            the study objectives.        All surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis under regional anesthesia and sedation       for the same team of three surgeons. Preoperative preparation consists of a cleansing enema       and no prophylactic antibiotics will be administered.        Both techniques will be performed in Jack -Knife position. The open hemorrhoidectomy may       include one to three anal cushions and made according to the Milligan-Morgan technique, with       resection of the anal cushion and the external hemorrhoidal epidermal component using       electrocautery and ligation of the hemorroidal base with absorbable suture. Once completed       hemorrhoidectomy a perianal block is performed with bupivacaine/epinephrine.        Hemorrhoidal artery ligation and rectoanal repair will be performed with the AMI minimally       invasive surgery device HAL/RAR, and consist in the ligation of the terminal branches of the       superior rectal artery with 2-0 absorbable polyglycolic acid suture after identifying the       blood flow approximately 3 cm above the dentate line by using Doppler guidance.       Subsequently, a running suture was added from the suture point to 5 mm above the dentate       line to lift the prolapsing hemorroid. Other procedures will not be associated, if       necessary, the patient will be excluded from the study .        The patient will be discharged if adequate pain control, oral tolerance and spontaneous       diuresis is achieved, and after examination by the surgeon in order to discard immediate       complications. The ambulatory treatment consists of an osmotic laxative magnesium hydroxide       , oral analgesia with paracetamol/tramadol  325mg/37.5mg  every 6 hours and Dexketoprofen       25 mg every 8 hours, metamizol 575 mg may be associated every 8 hours if pain. In case       of persistent pain, the patient will be examinated in emergency room.        EVALUATION OF RESULTS A power analysis was performed to assess the study sample size.       Choosing a power of 0.8 and a confidence interval of 95% α-error of 0.05, we calculated that       26 patients were needed in each arm. We increased this number up to 30 to increase       reliability of the study.        All patients will be evaluated with a validated questionnaire of 36 questions on quality of       life  SF-36  and specific questions about specific symptoms of hemorrhoidal disease pain,       itching , bleeding, soiling and hemorrhoidal prolapse reduction . The questionnaire will be       answered before the intervention, after six and twelve months of follow up.        All patients will complete a diary testing global postoperative pain every day, measured on       a numerical scale from 0 to 10 during the first 15 days.        The patients will be assessed on the day of discharge and at 7, 14, and 30 postoperative       days. The patients will be evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 postoperative months in the outpatient       clinic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The classic surgical treatment of hemorrhoidal disease is the excisional hemorrhoidectomy,       that consist in the surgical removal of one or more hemorrhoidal cushion, it is considered a       safe, radical and definitive treatment; however, it is not exempt of complications and the       postoperative pain is considerable. During the last two decades the concept of treatment has       evolved to control hemorrhoidal symptoms with less invasive techniques, such as hemorrhoidal       bands, arterial ligation Doppler guided hemorrhoidal and more recently, the association of       anorectal repair or mucopexia for treating hemorrhoidal mucosal prolapse .        The results of the doppler guided transanal dearterialization and rectoanal repair HAL-RAR       in the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease, show good control of symptoms, less postoperative       pain and low rates of complications in the treatment of grade II, III and IV hemorrhoids.1       -10        The advantages of the HAL- RAR could be more limited in advanced hemorrhoidal disease stage       IV, in this stage have been reported a recurrence rate of up to 38 % 4.        The studies with more patients treated with HAL- RAR are those of Faucheron et al3 100       patients and Roka et al6 77 patients. These studies reported good results in the       treatment of grade IV hemorrhoids with a high rate of outpatient treatment, good control of       symptoms 89 % and a low rate of complications. Te complications presented 9% in the       immediate postoperative period and 4% in the long term, all were treated conservatively.        Currently there are few prospective randomized studies that demonstrate the results of HAL-       RAR compared with open hemorrhoidectomy, the long-term results remain to be demonstrated.        In the literature there are two prospective randomized studies comparing the HAL- RAR with       excision hemorrhoidectomy1 -2. In both studies, good results were observed with these       techniques with regard to symptom control; postoperative pain and long-term results were       similar with both techniques.        The publication of more randomized prospective studies to allow proper evaluation of the       results in patients who underwent HAL- RAR is required. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  Patients with symptomatic grade III or IV hemorrhoids bleeding, pain, itching,              soiling or prolapse that are elegible for surgical treatment with both methods.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02221895","TITLE:       The Effect of Early Versus Traditional Follow-Up on Breastfeeding Rates at 6 Months SUMMARY:       The studys purpose is to determine if early 2-3 week versus traditional 6-8 week       postpartum follow up is associated with a higher rate of breastfeeding at 6 months. The       studys hypothesis is that follow up at 2-3 weeks postpartum is associated with a higher       rate of breastfeeding 6 months postpartum. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This study is a non-blinded randomized controlled trial with intent to treat analysis       intended to determine whether early 2-3 weeks postpartum-experimental arm versus       traditional 6-8 weeks postpartum-control arm follow up increases breastfeeding rates at 6       months postpartum. For purposes of this study, breastfeeding will be defined as any breast       milk produced by the mother and fed to her infant whether by placing the infant to the       breast or pumping/expressing milk and feeding it to the infant in another way. A literature       search failed to identify any study that evaluated benefits or shortcomings of an exclusive       short interval postpartum visit instead of the 6-8 week traditionally timed visit. Although       there may be practical reasons to delay postpartum follow up until 6-8 weeks after delivery,       there is no good data to support this, and it may remain the dominant practice due solely to       convention. Recent expert opinion has suggested that earlier postpartum follow up may be       more practical and provide an earlier or more convenient opportunity to provide assessment       and education to postpartum women [9]. Earlier follow up may present a more timely       opportunity to discuss family planning, breastfeeding, and screen for depression. Pierce       CountyWomen/Infants/Children Program WIC data indicates a 34% breastfeeding rate in the       military beneficiary population 6 months postpartum 2012 data. Using a sample size of 166       in the exposure and non-exposure arms would allow for detection of a 50% increase in the       outcome of the exposure arm using a two-sided test with α = 0.05 and β = 0.20. A 50%       increase in the rate of breastfeeding 6 months postpartum from 34% to 51% would be a       clinically significant increase that approximates the Surgeon Generals 2020 goal of a 60.6%       rate of breastfeeding at 6 months. We assume at 30% dropout rate, and therefore, plan to       recruit a total of 346 patients to the study.        Potential enrollees will be evaluated, recruited, and enrolled using the process described       in 6.2.3b. A screening and enrollment log will track all patients reviewed for eligibility       whether or not they met inclusion/exclusion criteria and, if so, whether participation in       the study was accepted or declined. Patients who agree to enroll will sign the required       study consent and complete the breastfeeding attrition prediction tool BAPT. With the       subjects assistance, the enrolling investigator will complete the demographic sheet. Once       these items are complete, randomization will occur. Randomization will be via       computer-generated block randomization with block sizes of six. Randomization and blocking       will be performed using the RAND function in Excel. Randomization will be performed by the       studys collaborating staff, who will have no direct contact with the potential subjects.       Treatment A will represent follow up 2-3 weeks postpartum. Treatment B will represent       follow up at 6-8 weeks postpartum. The randomized assignments denoted as either Treatment       A: 2-3 week follow up or Treatment B: 6-8 week follow up will be placed on a card within       sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes by the collaborating staff. The       randomization process, card, and envelope preparation will all be completed by the       collaborating staff without any involvement of the study investigators. These sequentially       numbered and sealed envelopes will be secured on Labor and Delivery until the study       investigator allocates an envelope to the enrollee. Once a patient agrees to enrollment, the       required demographic and screening tools are completed and the study consent form signed,       the box containing the sequentially numbered and sealed envelopes will be opened by the       study investigator and the patient will be given the next envelope in the sequence. Prior to       opening the envelope, the study investigator will denote on the enrollment log the date of       subject enrollment and the sequence number of the envelope assigned to the subject. The       envelope number assigned to the subject will be their study number. The subject will then       open the assigned envelope to determine their treatment assignment, and the study       investigator will denote the study arm assignment on the enrollment log.        Once assigned to a treatment arm, the screening and enrollment log designating treatment       assignments will be used to coordinate with the clerk in the Ob/Gyn Clinic, who will contact       the subject to schedule postpartum follow up at the allotted interval. The scheduled       appointments will be with providers nurse practitioners and nurse midwives not associated       with the study. At the postpartum visit, the subject will complete and return the postpartum       questionnaire, along with the Edinburgh perinatal depression screen, which is standard       screening completed by all postpartum patients. Subjects demonstrating an elevated       depression screen will be followed and assessed according to previously approved       departmental protocol MAMC Perinatal Screening Program Algorithm. Subjects who fail to       show up at the assigned follow up interval will be included in the 6-month postpartum       assessment. Subjects who return for follow up at intervals outside their assigned       appointment interval will also be contacted for the 6- month follow up and included in their       originally assigned group for data analysis intent-to-treat.        When the patient is 5-6 months postpartum, a study investigator will telephonically contact       the subject to obtain answers to the 6-month postpartum questionnaire. The questionnaire       will be reviewed by standardized script.        A multitude of factors influence breastfeeding success for mothers choosing to breastfeed.       Some of these factors include prior breastfeeding experience, maternal and fetal medical       complications, social support, attitudes, education, age, race, and other demographic       factors, as well as maternal-fetal proximity within the immediate postpartum period. To       minimize potential confounders and bias, we aim to enroll only primiparous mothers, as these       mothers are unlikely to have prior breastfeeding experience. Demographic information       collected will be used to perform subset analyses and evaluate the homogeneity of the two       study groups. The standardized assessment tools will be used to characterize maternal       attitudes and support for breastfeeding and will also be used for subset analysis. Some       neonates are unable to be with their mother immediately after birth due to a variety of       issues that may warrant observation in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit NICU or, in some       cases, due to maternal illness. We will also exclude mothers whose infants are not       rooming-in with them continuously for the first 48 hours postpartum, as this may pose a       potential barrier to initiating breastfeeding. To ensure the study is generalizable, we will       include mothers with spontaneous or operative deliveries, as well as cesarean deliveries,       which constitute approximately 16% nulliparous term singleton vertex cesarean birth rate at       our facility in 2012 of primiparous births at our facility, as long as the other       inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Additionally, some patients may present for enhanced       follow up in the case of a complicated delivery or postpartum complication or acute visits       within the first 8 weeks postpartum. These visits represent other opportunities outside the       typical postpartum follow up appointment for mothers to seek evaluation for breastfeeding       support or other concerns. We will collect data on the number and type of scheduled and       unscheduled provider encounters that occur within our medical system outside of the       scheduled postpartum follow up appointment. Furthermore, some subjects may fail to follow up       at the assigned interval. Data analysis will be via an intent-to-treat, therefore, subjects       assigned to one arm or the other who either fail to follow up at the assigned interval or       follow up more frequently will still be evaluated and assessed for the primary outcome.          1. Describe what will happen on this study that is EXPERIMENTAL: Subjects in the            experimental arm 2-3 week postpartum follow up will have their postpartum appointment            at an earlier interval that what is current considered the standard of care. All study            participants will complete the BAPT. Demographic data will be obtained for each subject            prior to their discharge. All subjects will also complete a standardized postpartum            questionnaire at their scheduled postpartum visit either 2-3 weeks or 6-8 weeks            depending on their arm of the study. All subjects will have a 6-month follow up via a            standardized/scripted phone survey.          2. Describe what will happen on this study that is STANDARD of CARE: The control arm of            the trial will be assigned to the traditional 6-8 week postpartum visit.

This increases risk of       cerebrovascular/cardiovascular event.        LVH is asymptomatic and managed by the use of medication to control blood pressure, however       LVH may be seen in normotensive patients where factors such as obesity and insulin       resistance are present.        Insulin resistance is a condition where although the body produces insulin it is unable to       utilize it effectively. Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, can reduce insulin       resistance and cause weight loss, it may therefore improve LVH. This study will investigate       the ability of metformin to reduce LVH in patients with heart disease, this may be a novel       way forward in the risk reduction of cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events. Participants       will be identified throughout NHS Tayside, those eligible will be randomly allocated to       either metformin or a dummy medication placebo and will receive one year of treatment. At       the beginning of the study, the thickness of the heart muscle will be measured by ultrasound       scan and cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging cMRI. We will also perform non-invasive tests       to measure blood vessel function. These tests will be repeated after one year. At the end of       the study, we will investigate the difference between placebo treatment and metformin       treatment.        This study is funded by the British Heart Foundation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This is a single centre trial designed to investigate the benefit, if any, of 12 month       metformin XL 2000mg/day treatment on left ventricular hypertrophy LVH in 64 nondiabetic       participants with Ischaemic heart disease IHD and insulin resistance IR.        Participants will be seen on seven occasions: screening, baseline/randomisation, 2 weeks       post randomisation, month 1, month 4, month 8 and final month 12, during which vital signs       and safety bloods will be performed. There will also be three telephone visits at: month 2,       month 6 and month 10.        At a screening visit an initial history will be performed following informed consent.       Participants will then undergo an echocardiogram a painless ultrasound scan of the heart       in the Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. Blood pressure will       be recorded and blood tests to determine fasting insulin resistance index FIRI and routine       safety, prior to metformin administration, will be performed.        Participants who meet all inclusion criteria will return for the randomisation visit within       4 weeks of screening where a Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging cMRI scan will be       performed followed by randomisation to either Metformin XL or placebo in a double blind,       randomised fashion. Also, at this visit endothelial function tests will be performed to       assess peripheral blood vessels in the forearm, central obesity will be quantified using       waist circumference and waist to hip ratio WHR and study specific blood sampling performed       with participant consent.        At the final visit or early withdrawal the following will be performed: vital signs, safety       bloods, study specific bloods with participant consent, echocardiography, endothelial       function tests and cMRI.        In the active arm, therapy will be metformin XL in an initial dose of 1000mg/day metformin       XL 500mg x2/day. Participants will continue on Metformin XL 500mg x2/day for two weeks,       following safety blood checks this dose will be increased to 2000 mg/day. If the higher dose       cannot be tolerated it will be reduced to 1000mg/day or stopped if not tolerated.        The target dose of metformin XL at 2000mg/day was chosen based on a previous study of       metformin in nondiabetic heart failure patients with IR, this study demonstrated a       beneficial effect of metformin on insulin resistance, weight reduction and an improvement in       submaximal exercise. The study used the immediate release form of metformin target of 1000       mg x2/day which was associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects resulting in       13% withdrawal of study medication. For this reason we have selected metformin XR due to       improved gastrointestinal tolerability.

The investigators are recruiting women from the       approximately 10,000 women who were enrolled and followed over the course of their first       pregnancy in another study. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute NHLBI, in collaboration with the Eunice       Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, is funding this       follow-up study of the nuMoM2b cohort to evaluate the association between adverse pregnancy       outcomes APOs and cardiovascular health approximately 2 to 3½ years postpartum. The study,       called the nuMoM2b Heart Health Study or nuMoM2b HHS, utilizes the extensive database and       tissue bank developed for nuMoM2b in which nulliparous women are evaluated over the course       of pregnancy to study the mechanisms for and prediction of APOs. Women enrolled in the       nuMoM2b cohort are extremely well phenotyped through prospective data collection, clinical       evaluations, and ultrasound assessments, as well as through the use of standardized       definitions. Demographic, psychosocial, dietary, physiologic, and outcome information were       collected through maternal interviews, self-administered questionnaires, clinical       measurements, ultrasounds, and medical record abstraction. Samples of maternal blood, urine,       and cervico-vaginal fluid over pregnancy and cord blood and placenta at delivery were       collected and banked. All women completed two sleep questionnaires and over 3,600 had       objective overnight sleep studies at two times during pregnancy.        Women participating in the nuMoM2b are assessed in nuMoM2b HHS for evidence of       cardiovascular disease risk CVDR, including sleep disordered breathing SDB, at 2 to 3½       years postpartum. APOs in subsequent pregnancies also are assessed. This study characterizes       the relationship between APOs and CVDR, identify first pregnancy profiles that portend       subsequent CVDR, determine associations between SDB during the first pregnancy and       subsequent CVDR, and identify modifiable factors that mediate the associations between CVDR       and APOs in the first and subsequent pregnancy. This follow-up study will allow for the       development of strategies to modify these CVDR factors and to improve the health of women       suffering APOs.        The nuMoM2b Heart Health Study is a prospective observational study that includes interval       contacts and a detailed cardiovascular assessment 2 to 3½ years after delivery of the index       pregnancy. At the cardiovascular assessment, potentially eligible women are invited to       attend a cardiovascular screening visit. After informed consent, a urine pregnancy test is       performed to confirm eligibility. The visit includes clinical and laboratory measurements as       well as a structured interview to assess domains that were measured in the nuMoM2b       pregnancy: physical activity, depression, social support, psychological stress, and       nutritional status. Women with sleep breathing assessments during their nuMoM2b pregnancy       are offered another overnight sleep study.        The overarching goal is to better define the relation between outcomes of pregnancy and long       term health of the mother. The specific aims are as follows:        Aim 1: Define the incidence of hypertension and the cardiovascular disease risk CVDR       profile of women approximately 2 to 3½ years after a first pregnancy complicated by       preeclampsia or other adverse pregnancy outcomes APOs: stillbirth, small for gestational       age at birth [SGA], preterm birth, preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension,       gestational diabetes [GDM] compared to women having no APOs in the first pregnancy.        Aim 2: Identify a profile in early pregnancy that portends subsequent CVDR approximately 2       to 3½ years postpartum.        Aim 3: Determine whether pregnancy and postpartum sleep disordered breathing SDB is       associated with increased CVDR and identify specific patterns of pregnancy and postpartum       SDB that increase CVDR.        Aim 4: Identify modifiable factors during and after pregnancy that mediate the associations       between APOs and the CVDR during pregnancy and approximately 2 to 3½ years postpartum. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:          Interval Contact:            -  Agreed to contact for future studies during nuMoM2b and not subsequently withdrawn              from the cohort.            -  Have pregnancy outcome data from the nuMoM2b study.            -  At least 18 years of age to begin interval contact attempts once nuMoM2b participant              reaches age 18.            -  Provision of verbal consent for telephone interview or acknowledgement of consent              with completion of the web-based self-administered questionnaire.

The true incidence is unknown,       and may range from 1% to 15%. At the current time, the clinical practice of VTE prophylaxis       in thoracic surgery includes administration of unfractionated or low molecular weight       heparin starting at the perioperative period and finishing at the time of patients       discharge. In orthopaedic surgery, prolonged thromboprophylaxis beyond 10 days and up to 35       days has become the standard of care. There is a clear need to systematically evaluate the       incidence of VTE after resection of lung malignancies and to evaluate the role of extended       VTE prophylaxis in preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis DVT and pulmonary embolus PE after       those major lung resections. This study will involve patients undergoing lung resection for       malignancy at St. Josephs Healthcare Hamilton and the University Health Networks Toronto       General Hospital. The study will include 150 consecutively recruited patients. Study       interventions will include Computed Tomography with pulmonary embolus PE protocol and       bilateral extended leg Doppler Ultrasound for the detection of Deep Vein Thrombosis 30 days       post-surgery.        In summary, this study is aimed at evaluating, for the first time in a prospective manner,       the actual incidence of DVT and PE in patients undergoing major lung resections for       malignancies. The knowledge gained in this study will be used to inform a future       investigation involving a Randomized Controlled Trial RCT to compare current       post-operative thromboprophylaxis with an extended 30-day prophylaxis protocol with the hope       of providing an evidence-based practice change in VTE prophylaxis care for this high risk       population. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Postoperative venous thromboembolism VTE is a significant health-care problem, resulting       in significant morbidity, mortality and resource utilization. The true incidence is unknown,       and may range from 1% to 15%. The latest American College of Chest Physicians ACCP       guidelines on VTE prevention clearly outlines the perioperative thromboprophylaxis regiments       for specific surgical populations. Specifically for patients undergoing orthopaedic       procedures, such as total hip replacement, there is strong Grade 1A evidence for the use of       extended thromboprophylaxis. For other surgical subgroups such as vascular and thoracic       surgery, the evidence is less clear.        Therefore at the current time, the clinical practice of VTE prophylaxis in thoracic surgery       includes administration of unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin starting at the       perioperative period and finishing at the time of patients discharge. Prolonged       thromboprophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery beyond 10 days and up to 35 days has become the       standard of care and has Grade 1A recommendations from ACCP. This approach has never been       tested or validated in thoracic surgery, where major lung resection exposes the patient to       an increased VTE risk not only due to the surgical stress and existence of malignancy, but       also due to direct in-situ vascular injury secondary to resection of pulmonary arterial       branches during the lung resection. Hence, there is a clear need to systematically evaluate       the incidence of VTE after resection of lung malignancies and to evaluate the role of       extended VTE prophylaxis in preventing DVT and pulmonary embolus PE after those major lung       resections.        The study will involve patients undergoing sub-lobar resection, lobectomy, bilobectomy or       pneumonectomy for lung cancer or metastatic lung disease at St. Josephs Healthcare       Hamilton, a regional tertiary thoracic surgery program with more than 350 major lung       resections performed within the institution annually, as well as the University Health       Networks Toronto General Hospital. The study will evaluate the incidence of post-operative       venous thromboembolism VTE and will include 150 consecutively recruited patients. Study       interventions will include Computed Tomography with pulmonary embolus PE protocol and       bilateral extended leg Doppler Ultrasound for the detection of Deep Vein Thrombosis 30 days       post-surgery.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02264769","TITLE:       Carbetocin at Elective Cesarean Delivery Part 4 SUMMARY:       PostPartum hemorrhage PPH is a major cause of maternal death worldwide. Oxytocin is the       most commonly used uterotonic drug to prevent and treat PPH in North America. However       oxytocin has a very short duration of action, requiring a continuous infusion to achieve       sustained uterotonic activity. Moreover large doses are associated with adverse effects like       hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dysrhythmias and ST changes. The Society of Obstetricians and       Gynecologists of Canada SOGC has recommended a single dose of 100 mcg of carbetocin at       elective cesarean delivery to promote uterine contraction. In three studies recently       performed at Mount Sinai Hospital, the investigators have found no difference in uterine       contractility between the doses of 20- 120 mcg carbetocin and that the ED90 is 14.8 mcg.       Thus a larger trial comparing the minimum effective dose determined in the previous three       trials with the standard 100 mcg dose is necessary to confirm these findings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The current oxytocin regimen requires the administration of a continuous infusion to achieve       sustained uterotonic activity, which can be associated with a number of side effects and       unpredictable efficacy. Carbetocin in a single 100 mcg dose has apparently greater efficacy,       with a similar side effect profile to that of oxytocin. In addition, some studies have also       shown that there is less blood loss and less requirement for additional uterotonic drugs       when carbetocin is administered. Studies conducted by the investigators group at Mount Sinai       have shown similar efficacy between the doses ranging from 20 to 100 mcg of carbetocin. In       the investigators study, the investigators are going to compare those two doses of       carbetocin to determine that 20 mcg is not inferior to 100 mcg to produce adequate uterine       tone in elective cesarean delivery. This study will be a randomized, double - blind, non       inferiority study.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02266563","TITLE:       Amyloid and Tauopathy PET Imaging in Acute and Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury SUMMARY:       The potential long-term effects of Traumatic Brain Injury TBI are poorly understood.       Repeated concussions have been associated with an elevated incidence of Alzheimers disease       AD along with a reduced age of onset. As repetitive TBI has been studied, a syndrome has       now been identified: chronic traumatic encephalopathy CTE. There are growing concerns       about the long-term neurologic consequences of head impact exposure from routine       participation in contact sports e.g., boxing, football. Brain autopsies of athletes with       confirmed CTE have demonstrated tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil       threads known as tauopathy. The relationship between exposure to repetitive head impact       and the subsequent development of chronic neurodegenerative disease has not been       established. Further, as the diagnosis of CTE defined by the presence of tauopathy is       presently made after death at autopsy, clinical tools and biomarkers for detecting it remain       to be defined.        With the advent of FDA-approved PET amyloid imaging, clinicians and researchers are now able       to estimate plaque density in the brains of living patients. However, there are critical       limitations to amyloid imaging. Current evidence suggests that markers of the presence and       severity of tauopathy may be able to address these limitations. The study will utilize both       [18F] Florbetapir and [18F]-T807 PET imaging to investigate amyloid and tau accumulation in       subjects with a history of concussions. In order to determine whether problems with       cognition and memory are seen within the populations defined for the study, the researchers       will administer a core battery of neurocognitive testing. This battery will assess cognitive       abilities commonly affected by TBI, including processing speed, reaction time, new       problem-solving, executive functions, attention and concentration, and learning and memory.       These tests, in conjunction with the imaging, will be able to determine whether regional       brain activity is associated with specific cognitive problems. The researchers will obtain       PET and neurocognitive data in 3 cohorts: subjects with a history of TBIs, subjects with       mild cognitive impairment MCI and no TBI history, and healthy controls.        The investigators aim to determine whether individuals with TBI are on the same trajectory       of neurodegenerative disease seen in AD or in CTE. Because of the overlap in       clinical/cognitive and some behavioral symptoms in AD and CTE, an additional biomarker tool       is needed to prevent misdiagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is crucial in order to provide       patients with appropriate treatment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The study involves two days of study visits. Subjects will be given a copy of the consent       form on the morning of their first visit, and sign consent in a private room at Mount Sinai       before any research related procedures are conducted. Subjects will then be brought to the       Hess Center for Science in Medicine for injection for the [18F] AV-45 or Amyvid PET scan.       On the second visit, which is to be conducted the day after the first visit, subjects will       have the [18F]AV-1451 or T807 PET scan and complete the neuropsychological testing       battery.        Both PET scans will be done entirely for the purpose of research. The scans will be read by       nuclear medicine physicians and a clinical report will be sent to the PI. Any clinically       relevant findings will be sent to the treating physician and will be communicated to       patients. During both visits, subjects will be allowed time for meals and breaks between       study procedures.        Details of procedures:        Amyvid PET scan: At the first visit, each participant will have an Amyvid PET scan. The scan       involves use of a tracer, which is a radioactive sugar-like substance. This type of PET       scan involves a tracer called AV-45 also known as Florbetapir, and by the trade name of       Amyvid. It has been approved by the FDA for use in PET imaging. It binds to beta-Amyloid       plaques that may or may not be present in the brain. Amyloid plaque is a sticky substance       protein that accumulates in the brain in larger amounts in people who may have Alzheimers       disease. A thin line will be inserted into a vein in one arm for the injection of the       tracer. Subjects will begin the Amyvid PET scan 50-60 minutes after the injection of the       tracer, and scanned for about 20 minutes.        T807 PET scan: On the day of the second visit, each participant will have an [F18] AV-1451       PET scan, also known as a T807 PET scan. This type of PET scan is being studied by the FDA       as a diagnostic tool. This PET scan involves a very similar procedure to the Amyvid PET scan       the day before. Like the Amyvid scan, a thin line will be inserted into a vein in one arm       for the injection of the AV-1451 radiotracer. This tracer binds to clusters of Tau protein       inside the brain called neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles are associated with both       Alzheimers disease and memory problems that may be related to multiple head injuries or       concussions. Scanning will begin 80 minutes after the injection of the tracer, and last for       about 20 minutes.        Neuropsychological testing battery: The neuropsychological assessment is a battery of pencil       and paper tests that measure memory and thinking abilities. In total it takes about two       hours to complete.

Its occurrence is associated with worse outcomes of patients, including increased morbidity,       prolonged hospital stay, increased medical cost, and higher mortality. It is also associated       with long-term cognitive decline and decreased quality of life. However, until recently,       pharmacological interventions that can effectively prevent its occurrence are still limited.       The purpose of this study is to investigate whether perioperative dexmedetomidine use can       decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Delirium is a state of global cerebral dysfunction manifested by acute disturbance of       consciousness, attention, cognition and perception. It develops over a short period of time       usually hours to days and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day. The reported       incidences of delirium after cardiac surgery varied from 21% to 47%. The occurrence of       postoperative delirium has significant harmful effects on patients outcomes, including       increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, increased medical cost, and higher mortality.       Its occurrence is also associated with long-term cognitive decline and decreased quality of       life.        The exact pathogenesis that lead to the occurrence of POD are still unclear, and possibly       involves mechanisms such as inflammation, pain and sleep deprivation after surgery.       Furthermore, it has been shown that anesthesia management might also have exerted some       effects. Studies found that avoidance of unnecessary deep anesthesia under the guidance of       Bispectral Index monitoring decreases the incidence of POD. Theoretically, measures that       decreases the requirement of anesthetics while maintaining adequate depth of anesthesia and       those that alleviates inflammation and improves postoperative analgesia as well as sleep       quality will decrease the incidence of POD.        Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists that provides       anxiolysis, sedation and modest analgesia with minimal respiratory depression. Studies       showed that, when used as an adjunctive anesthetics, dexmedetomidine significantly decreases       the requirement of opioid analgesics and other sedatives during anesthesia. A recent study       of our group found that continuous infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine 0.2 ug/kg/h during       the first night after surgery significantly improved subjective sleep quality. Two       randomized controlled trials found that, when compared with traditional sedatives midazolam       and propofol and analgesics such as morphine, use of dexmedetomidine in patients after       cardiac surgery is associated with decreased risk of delirium. However, questions still       exist as to whether dexmedetomidine prevent delirium or just does not increase its       occurrence since traditional sedatives/analgesics themselves increases the risk of delirium.       Furthermore, animal experiments showed that dexmedetomidine inhibits the degree of       inflammation induced by endotoxins.        The investigators hypothesize that use of dexmedetomidine as an adjunctive agent during the       perioperative period can decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients       undergoing cardiac surgery, possibly by decreasing the requirement of anesthetics during       surgery, by ameliorating analgesia as well as sleep quality after surgery, and by       alleviating the degree of perioperative inflammatory response.

The study mainly       focus on glomerular filtration rateGFR with known relation to the renal function and 24       hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric bypass or medical       treatment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with obesity and the patients with this syndrome       are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.        Obesity constitutes a strong risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease.       Among diabetics, obesity is known to amplify the risk for kidney disease.        Bariatric surgery has yielded dramatic results including longitudinal loss of excess body       weight and either complete reversal or significant improvement of several features of       metabolic syndrome. In addition, many observational studies have demonstrated significant       reduction in proteinuria after bariatric surgery.        However, the changes in the component of cardiovascular problem among metabolic syndrome and       changes in renal filtration function or progression to end stage kidney disease in morbidly       obese patients after weight loss surgery have not been extensively studied. Therefore, our       study mainly focus on glomerular filtration rateGFR with known relation to the renal       function and 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric       bypass or medical treatment.

In a following study, the hypothesis will be tested in a larger ACS population       with major adverse cardiovascular events MACE after ACS as the endpoint.        Rationale for conducting this study:        ACS i.e. ST-elevation myocardial infarction STEMI and non- ST-elevation myocardial       infarction non-STEMI are the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in western       societies. Hypertension is a major risk factor for development of ACS and heart failure but       it also worsens the prognosis in patients after ACS. Our research highlights the combination       therapy of PCI and RDN in an ACS patient population with simultaneous hypertension.        Primary objective:        The primary objective of this study is to establish safety and efficacy of combined       treatment with PCI and renal denervation RDN in hypertensive patients with acute coronary       syndromes STEMI and non-STEMI  having ventricular mass after 4 months as the primary       variable.        Endpoints:        The primary end point is change in left ventricular mass LVM at 4 months evaluated by       magnetic resonance imaging MRI.        Secondary endpoints:, blood pressure office and 24-h ABPM, and left ventricular volumes       and ejection fraction. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The sympathetic nervous system plays a crucial role in the development and progression of       hypertension and its adverse consequences. Despite the availability of numerous effective       pharmacologic treatments, adequate blood pressure control is not achieved in a large number       of subjects. Patients with essential hypertension generally have increased efferent       sympathetic drive to the kidneys and an increased rate of sympathetic-nerve firing, possibly       modulated by afferent signalling from renal sensory nerves. Recently developed endovascular       catheter technology enables selective denervation of the human kidney. A safety and       feasibility trial of this procedure identified substantial reductions of blood pressure       without substantial procedure-related complications. The therapeutic value seems to be       present not only in hypertension but may also be of interest in many clinical conditions       e.g. heart failure, chronic end-stage renal disease and insulin resistance and diabetes.        The present study COMBI-RDN is a randomised clinical trial in 40 patients to investigate       safety and efficacy of the combination of Percutan Coronar Interventiom PCI and renal       denervation RDN where RDN is performed early after acute coronary syndrome ACS. This       study is considered a pilot study to evaluate efficacy and safety in patients with ACS. In a       second phase there will be a randomised, multicenter study in approximately 2500 patients to       demonstrate whether RDN early post ACS could decrease major adverse cardiovascular events in       hypertensive patients with ACS.        Research hypothesis Is the treatment with renal denervation RDN early post ACS safe and       effective and does it leads to improved cardiac function and attenuation of pathologic left       ventricular remodelling?

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02290405","TITLE:       Impact of Hyperarousal on Simple and Complex Cognitive Task Performance Among Insomnia Sufferers SUMMARY:       The purpose of this study is to learn more about people with insomnia disorder and cognitive       impairment. Cognitive impairment is difficulty with mental abilities such as thinking,       knowing and remembering. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Primary insomnia PI sufferers typically complain of such daytime impairments as reduced       attention, concentration, memory and global mental acuity. Moreover, epidemiological studies       have shown PI contributes to reduced productivity, work and traffic accidents, and serious       falls among the elderly. Despite such findings, laboratory-based efforts to corroborate the       cognitive complaints of PI sufferers have produced mixed results. Indeed, many studies       comparing PI sufferers with non-complaining normal sleepers across a range of       neuropsychological tests have failed to show any relative deficits among the PI group. Such       findings, in turn, has led to the impression that PI patients cognitive complaints may be       over-stated and result from their attentional bias toward minor cognitive errors,       dysfunctional beliefs about the impact of insomnia on functioning or excessive self focus       rather than to any measurable daytime impairment.        However, many previous such studies were underpowered due to small sample sizes and employed       neuropsychological tests designed for detecting impairment resulting from brain       disease/damage rather than the more subtle albeit significant impairments of which PI       patients complain. In recent research, we and others have shown that PI sufferers do,       indeed, show greater deficits slower and more variable reaction times particularly on       complex switching attention tasks. Moreover, there is some preliminary evidence that the       subgroup of PI sufferers with elevated levels of physiological hyperarousal are most prone       to suffer from neuro-cognitive performance deficits than are matched groups of PI sufferers       who are not physiologically hyperaroused and normally alert individuals without insomnia.       For example, Fernandez-Mendoza recently showed that PI sufferers with a hyperarousal pattern       suggested by their objective short sleep duration on serial polysomnograms PSG performed       more poorly on a complex switching attention task than did both normal sleepers and PI       sufferers with normal objective sleep durations.        In our efforts to follow up on this latter work, we recently examined the error rates of       alert and sleepy PI sufferers and normal sleepers across a series of simple and complex       reaction time tasks. We employed age and gender matched samples of PI N=89 sufferers and       normal sleepers-NS N=95. Participants underwent three nights of PSG followed by daytime       testing with a four-trial Multiple Sleep Latency Test-MSLT. The PI and NS groups were each       subdivided into alert e.g., MSLT mean onset latency > 8 minutes and sleepy e.g., MSLT       mean onset latency < 8 minutes subgroups to allow for testing the main and interaction       effects of participant type and level of alertness. Alert participants had longer MSLT       latencies than sleepy participants 12.7 vs. 5.4 minutes. PI sufferers had fewer correct       responses on performance testing than did NS. However, as shown by the adjacent, figure we       found a significant group x alertness interaction p = .0013 with greater error rates       occurring among alert hyperaroused PI sufferers Mean=4.5±3.6 errors per trial than among       alert NS Mean=2.6±1.9 errors per trial. This was particularly true for the more complex       switching attention task.        Our work along with that of Fernandez-Mendoza serve to confirm that PI sufferers have       measureable objective neuro-cognitive deficits and provide some preliminary suggestion for       the types of testing approaches that should be used to detect them. The identification of       tests sensitive to PI sufferers cognitive deficits are particularly relevant for testing       the effects of current and future insomnia therapies on patients objective daytime       functioning. Measures of daytime dysfunction can and should serve as endpoints for assessing       benefits and detriments of insomnia therapies. In addition, our recent work suggests that       subgroups of PI sufferers may differ in their daytime deficits, with those showing       physiological hyperarousal being most prone to make errors. This finding suggests that       different types or doses of treatment may be needed to reverse the daytime impairments of       the hyperaroused and non-aroused PI patients. However, our line of research would benefit by       replication and extension findings to 1 further confirm the detrimental effects of       physiological hyperarousal on PI sufferers neuro-cognitive functioning; and 2 identify a       broader range of tests that can be used for assessing diurnal cognitive impairments in both       physiologically hyperaroused and lesser aroused PI groups. The current project will address       these aims.

Therefore the investigators will have a randomized clinical       study in patients with severe preeclampsia who have been treated with impregnation of       magnesium sulphate and at least eight hours have received the drug before birth. If the       patient agrees and signs the consent is randomized to: 1-receive sulfate for 24 hours       postpartum as usual or, 2- not receiving the postpartum magnesium sulfate or other       anticonvulsant drugs. This study can be conducted in 12 maternity latin america. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The final treatment known for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is the termination of pregnancy.       However to prevent eclampsia in patients with severe pre-eclampsia has been demonstrated the       effectiveness of magnesium sulfate. There are multiple studies that prove the effectiveness       of magnesium sulfate to prevent eclampsia in patients with severe disorder of blood pressure       during pregnancy. These studies used the drug before birth and continue after birth.       Therefore the investigators can not conclude whether the administration just before       pregnancy is sufficient to prevent seizure. If the cure or definitive treatment of       pre-eclampsia is the interruption, did not seem necessary to justify the administration of       drugs anti-eclampsia after birth. Obvious post delivery management with magnesium sulfate       arises from the large number of postpartum eclampsia reported in many studies. It is unknown       whether administration of magnesium sulfate for a minimum period before delivery, requires       even keep the drug post partum.        In addition to magnesium sulfate postpartum, is necessary to maintain urinary catheter to       monitoring the removal of magnesium sulfate; is usual to maintain the patient at all or       almost all rest by monitoring sulfate and diuresis , this prevents a proper relationship       mother and babe and even prevents breastfeeding during that period and is also known       increased risk of secondary thromboembolism due to prolonged rest in the postpartum /       caesarean section.Thus, maintain magnesium sulfate for 24 hours carries a higher cost,       greater vigilance and some risks, without known real effect.        A randomized clinical study conducted by Belfort and colleagues and published in January       2003, where magnesium sulphate compared to nimodipine to prevent eclampsia in women with       severe pre-eclampsia, showed interesting outcome. Such research analyzed 819 randomized       patients in the nimodipine group and 831 in the magnesium sulfate group. Magnesium sulphate       was better than Nimodipine in preventing eclampsia. Interestingly, the greater effectiveness       of sulfate appears to prevent all eclampsia postpartum 9 vs 0 and obviously was used       before the termination of pregnancy, however no difference compared with nimodipine in       eclampsia before birth 12 vs 7.        There are two possible reasons for the non-appearance of postpartum eclampsia: 1- maintain       postpartum magnesium sulfate, 2- dose 12-13 grams before birth disruption are sufficient to       prevent eclampsia.        The MAGPIE study randomized 1335 postpartum patients unused sulphate before delivery using       magnesium sulfate postpartum / cesarean 696 women or placebo postpartum / cesarean 639       women, and found no significant difference in the amount of eclampsia . Thus, the use of       magnesium sulfate for first time in the postpartum is not better to use a placebo. If the       investigators combine the findings of eclampsia postpartum Belfort study and MAGPIE study is       logical to think that the success of the Belfort study in the postpartum is not for the use       of magnesium sulfate post delivery and not only due to the termination of pregnancy because       there are postpartum eclampsia in the nimodipine group.        If the investigators consider unjustified use of magnesium sulfate postpartum, when       maintained at least 8 hours before delivery, the investigators decided to make a       non-inferiority randomized study.The investigators assume that using or not using magnesium       sulfate during the postpartum prevents similar amount of postpartum eclampsia, if during       pregnancy was used impregnation and at least 8 hours before birth.        For all these reasons the investigators propose the following: A randomized trial is       necessary where all those patients who received magnesium sulfate for at least 8 hours       before birth involves impregnation and maintenance 8 hours will be randomized to two       groups of study: 1- Continue magnesium sulfate for 24 hours and 2-not use magnesium sulfate       or other anticonvulsant drug post delivery.

Although the involvement of men in       maternity care has been shown to be a promising strategy for the achievement of other       reproductive health goals, little is known about the effect of their participation on these       outcomes. This study aims to test whether the involvement of men can improve care-seeking       and promote healthy behaviours among postpartum women in Burkina Faso. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       There is a paucity of evidence on strategies to increase the uptake of postpartum       contraception and attendance at facility-based postpartum care in developing countries,       including in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is also a need to test new solutions to improve       adherence to recommended infant feeding practices in these settings. Partner opposition is a       major barrier to womens uptake of contraceptive methods in the postpartum period in Burkina       Faso, and research has shown the need to sensitise and inform men about a broad range of       topics related to reproductive health. However, the effect of involving male partners on       womens and newborns health and wellbeing in low-resource settings is not well known, and       there is particularly little evidence for outcomes related to the postpartum period.

Secondary Endpoints - Efficacy:          -  Subjects satisfactions with the aesthetic outcome at 3 months post the implantation of            the anchoring system and their respective hair extensions.          -  Investigator satisfaction based on subjective evaluation and photos at 3 months post            the implantation of the anchoring system and their respective hair extensions.          -  Optional- Subjects satisfactions with the aesthetic outcome at 6 months post the            implantation of the anchoring system and their respective hair extensions.          -  Optional- Investigator satisfaction based on subjective evaluation and photos at 12            months post the implantation of the anchoring system and their respective hair            extensions.          -  Optional- Subjects satisfactions with the aesthetic outcome at 6 months post the            implantation of the anchoring system and their respective hair extensions.          -  Optional- Investigator satisfaction based on subjective evaluation and photos at 12            months post the implantation of the anchoring system and their respective hair            extension.        STUDY PROCEDURE - Once the subject was shown to be eligible for the study per eligibility       criteria and after signing the Informed Consent Form and the post implantation maintenance       protocol, and the investigator have signed the eligibility statement, the subject will       undergo the Hairstetics Anchoring System implantation up to 10 sets of Anchoring System       to which hair extensions will be attached. The implantation will be done according to the       devices IFU.        In the first stage, 6 subjects will be followed for 3 months, and in the second stage       additional up to 20 subjects will be followed for 3 months post the implantation of the       anchoring systems and their respective hair extensions. In this second stage, subjects who       wish to continue the follow-up voluntarily may do so up to one year with optional visits at       6 months and 12 months.        SUBJECT POPULATION - Men and Women with hair loss of different etiologies, including post       radiation/chemotherapy alopecia, post-burn alopecia, cicatricial alopecia, androgenetic       alopecia or alopecia due to traumatic injuries or skin disease, altogether presents with       hair thinning, that are scheduled for treating with hair extensions and who are eligible to       be recruited according to the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.        STUDY DURATION - For the first stage, the anticipated enrollment rate is expected to be       approximately 2 subjects per month, per site, so it is expected to take 1.5 months to enroll       from 2 sites and additional 3 months for follow-up. Then, for the second stage, the       recruitment rate is expected to be the same, and therefore the duration will be up to 5       months for recruiting and additional 3 months follow-up. So, the total study is 4.5 months       stage 1 + 8 months stage 2 to reach 12.5 months in total and potentially up to 21.5       months due to the optional follow up of 12 months.

Delirium assessment through standardized questionnaires will be done at baseline day of the       surgery - pre operatory, immediately after surgery in post anesthesia care unit and then       every 12 hours in Day 1 and Day2 after surgery. The investigators will use linear mixed       models to describe the change patterns overtime, and compare differences at each time point.       Inflammatory biomarkers will be explored overtime as well. The investigators will also       explore age effect on cognitive function - cognitive reserve - based on the score of the       cognitive test administered at baseline. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Specific circulating microRNAs have been identified in patients with neurological diseases       or deficits, and specifically those with neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore,       available evidence primarily in pre-clinical / animal models supports the hypothesis that       post-surgical/anesthesia - induced neuroinflammation leads to post-operative cognitive       decline or dysfunction. The investigators hypothesize that specific circulating microRNAs       involved in the pro-inflammatory response to surgery/anesthesia are a suitable biomarker of       Delirium and/or POCD in surgical hip-arthroplasty patients. However, it is also possible       that microamboli during the surgical procedure could contribute to these neurologic       outcomes. Therefore, in addition to analyzing microRNA levels our primary target, the       investigators propose to monitor cerebral vascular flow during the surgery to possibly       identify microambolic events using Transcranial Doppler. Overall, our overarching goal is to       identify novel early clinical indicators of cognitive dysfunction e.g. Delirium and POCD.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02347111","TITLE:       Pilot Pharmacogenetic Study of Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Atrial Fibrillation SUMMARY:       In this pilot and feasibility study, the investigators will enroll patients with frequent       symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation AF in a cross-over study testing two different       classes of anti arrhythmic drugs AADs. This pilot and feasibility study will provide       preliminary data for a larger study in which the investigators will test the hypothesis that       a common AF genetic risk allele modulates response to different AADs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       1.0 Background        While atrial fibrillation AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia requiring       therapy, it is also associated with increased risk of stroke, heart failure, myocardial       infarction, dementia, and death. The number of Americans affected with AF is expected to       surge to nearly 16 million by the year 2050. The AF epidemic may in part be related to the       aging of the population and increasing prevalence of recently identified risk factors       including obesity, metabolic syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and inflammation.       Furthermore, there is increasing support for the idea that both common and rare genetic       variants also increase susceptibility to AF which can clinically manifest in the presence of       acquired risk factors. While clinical risk factors for AF are established, the genetic       components of this multiple-hit genetic model for the development of AF have only recently       been identified.        Despite recent advances in catheter-based and surgical therapies, anti-arrhythmic drugs       AADs remain the mainstay of treatment for patients with symptomatic AF. However, response       in an individual is highly variable with more than half of patients treated with AADs       suffering a recurrence of AF within 6 to 12 months. The limited success of therapy for AF is       related to poor understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, heterogeneity of the       electrical and structural substrate, and the lack of targeted mechanism-based therapies.       Thus, one major knowledge gap is predicting response to AADs in an individual patient.       Contemporary membrane-active drugs used to suppress AF are incompletely and unpredictably       effective and are associated with significant risks of proarrhythmia and non-cardiac       toxicities. Furthermore, the current one-size fits all approach to selecting AAD therapy       for a patient with symptomatic AF is based largely on minimizing the risk of adverse events       rather than on the likelihood of efficacy. Recent advances in our understanding of genetic       mechanisms of AF support the overarching hypothesis we wish to test in future studies that       variability in response to AAD therapy is modulated by common genetic variants associated       with AF. Several AF susceptibility loci have been identified and validated in genome-wide       association studies. In addition, we have shown that common AF risk single nucleotide       polymorphisms SNPs at the chromosome chr 4q25 locus not only predict poor response to       AADs but also recurrence of AF after ablation therapy and cardioversion.        While genetic approaches to AF have revealed that susceptibility to AF and response to       therapy are modulated in part by the underlying genetic substrate, the translation of these       discoveries to the bedside management of AF patients has thus far been limited. This relates       to poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with common AF risk alleles,       challenges associated with determining efficacy of AADs and lack of genotype-directed       prospective studies. Our preliminary data showed that a common chr4q25 SNP associated with       AF predicted successful symptom control in patients treated with AADs and individuals who       carried the risk variant responded better to Vaughan Williams class I vs. class III AADs.       Based on the information collected in this feasibility and pilot study, we propose to       conduct a prospective pharmacogenomic study where a cohort of patients with frequent       symptomatic paroxysmal AF will be randomized to a flecainide class I AAD or sotalol class       III AAD in order to determine if response to therapy is modified by chr4q25 SNPs using AF       burden as a metric of drug efficacy. This main study, like the pilot study proposed here,       will utilize a crossover design to minimize inter-individual variability and maximize       statistical power to detect an interaction between chr4q25 genotype and the reduction of AF       burden with flecainide vs. sotalol. After a run-in period during which the AAD will be       up-titrated, subjects will be monitored with the Medtronic Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac       Monitor ICM system to assess AF burden. Furthermore, subjects will be asked to complete a       comprehensive, validated 20-item AF specific questionnaire AF Effect on QualiTy-of-life       [AFEQT] at baseline, and monthly thereafter for the duration of the study. At the end of       the 3-month trial period, the AAD will be discontinued and participants will be switched to       the other AAD and followed for another 3-month period in a crossover trial design.        2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims        We and others have shown common SNPs at the chr4q25 locus are associated with increased risk       of AF and modulate symptomatic response to AADs. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggests       that there is a differential response to class I vs. class III membrane-active drugs. Here,       we propose a pilot study to obtain preliminary data regarding AF burden in patients       receiving AADs and to demonstrate feasibility for a future study to test the hypothesis that       chr4q25 risk SNPs modulate differential response to AADs in patients with frequent       symptomatic paroxysmal AF using reduction in mean AF burden as a metric of drug efficacy.       Therefore, the Specific Aim of this pilot/feasibility study is to obtain preliminary data       regarding AF burden in patients receiving AADs and to demonstrate feasibility for a future       study to test the hypothesis that chr4q25 SNPs modulate differential response to class I vs.       class III AADs in patients with frequent symptomatic AF.        3.0 Previous Human Studies        Chr4q25 SNPs modulate differential response to AADs in patients with AF In a preliminary       study we addressed whether symptomatic response to AAD therapy is modulated by the 3 common       AF susceptibility loci on chr4q25 near PITX2, 16q22 in ZFHX3, and 1q21 in KCNN3. We       studied 478 discovery cohort and 198 validation cohort age and gender matched Caucasian       patients in the Vanderbilt AF Registry. Response to AAD therapy was defined as successful       rhythm control if the patient remained on the same AAD therapy for a minimum of 6 months       with ≥ 75% reduction in AF symptoms. Multiple clinical variables including age,       hypertension, lone AF failed to predict response to AADs. However, a SNP at the 4q25 locus       rs10033464 was significantly associated with successful symptom control odds ratio [OR]       2.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-6.21, P=0.003. Furthermore, individuals who carried       the 4q25 SNP responded better to class I vs. class III AADs in both the discovery and       validation cohorts. These preliminary findings provide the rationale for our future studies       by suggesting that common AF susceptibility variants differentially modify the response to       class I vs. class III AADs in patients with frequent symptomatic AF.        4.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria        Inclusion criteria          -  Caucasians ≥ 18 years of age          -  History of typical or lone symptomatic AF          -  AF symptoms present at least once per month          -  ECG that was recorded within 12 months of randomization showing AF          -  Starting a Class I or Class III AAD          -  In sinus rhythm at enrollment          -  Able to give informed consent        Exclusion criteria          -  Permanent AF or isolated atrial flutter.          -  Cardiac or thoracic surgery within the previous 6 months          -  Previous use of amiodarone other than short-term use e.g. for an acute arrhythmia in            hospital          -  Medical condition that is likely to be fatal in less than one year          -  Received 2 or more AADs in past          -  Creatinine clearance <40 ml/min          -  Contra-indication to a class I AAD e.g., structural heart disease, or history of MI          -  Contra-indication to a class III AAD, e.g., congenital or acquired long QT syndrome            with QTc>450 ms at baseline          -  A reversible cause of AF e.g., thyrotoxicosis          -  Previously treated with class I and class III antiarrhythmic drugs          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing.          -  History of severe AV node dysfunction unless an electronic pacemaker is present          -  Any race other than Caucasian          -  First- or second-degree relative has already participated in the study.        5.0 Enrollment/Randomization        Patients ≥18 years of age with symptomatic paroxysmal AF will be enrolled from the       Arrhythmia and Cardiology Clinics, the Adult Emergency Department, and inpatient Cardiology       services at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. For patients with whom researchers do not       have a relationship, introductions from a member of their care team will be sought prior to       discussion of the study. After obtaining the permission of the patient, a member of the       study team will explain the study, answer any questions, and allow sufficient time to be       certain that the subject understands the study and has given their consent to participate.       Consent will be documented by signing the informed consent document, a copy of which will be       given to the subject. For this pilot and feasibility study, we plan to recruit a total of 10       patients with a target enrollment of 1-2 patients monthly.        6.0 Study Procedures        Randomization: Patients will be treated with either flecainide or sotalol for 3 months and       then cross over to the alternate drug for 3 months. The order of assignment will be randomly       assigned using a permuted block design with alternate block sizes of 2 and 4 subjects. The       randomization list will be generated by the PI and provided to the Investigational Drug       Service IDS pharmacy. The study will be open-label.        Baseline visit procedures: The baseline visit will take place at the Vanderbilt Clinical       Research Center CRC. Patients will present to the CRC and be met by a study physician, who       will perform a history and physical exam. The CRC nurse will draw 30 ml of blood for DNA       extraction and subsequent genotyping. Plasma will be stored at -70 degrees C for future       studies. Blood will be sent to the Vanderbilt inpatient laboratory for analysis of the basic       metabolic panel. A baseline 12-lead ECG will be obtained for all patients and interpreted at       the bedside by the study physician. For patients randomized to start sotalol first, a       peripheral intravenous catheter will be placed. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria are       confirmed, the patient will receive his/her first dose of study medication sotalol 120 mg       by mouth or flecainide 50 mg by mouth, which will be dispensed by the IDS and given to the       patient. Per routine clinical practice, patients initiating flecainide will also be started       on atenolol 25 mg by mouth daily or diltiazem 120 mg long-acting by mouth daily if the       patient has contraindications to β-blockers to prevent the development of 1:1 conducted       atrial flutter.        Two hours after the first dose of study drug is given a 12-lead ECG will be recorded and       interpreted by the study physician. For patients initiating flecainide the PR interval and       QRS duration will be carefully scrutinized. If these remain unchanged, the patient will be       discharged from the CRC. For patients initiating sotalol, the QTc will be examined. If the       duration is >500 ms, the sotalol dose will be reduced to 80 mg by mouth twice daily.       Patients initiating sotalol will be admitted for continuous telemetric monitoring and will       remain in the CRC until after the 5th dose is administered. Additional 12-lead ECGs will be       obtained two hours after the 3rd and 5th doses of sotalol to assess QTc. If the duration       remains >500 ms on the reduced 80 mg dose of sotalol, the drug will be stopped and the       patient will be removed from the study. If the QTc remains ≤500 ms after the 5th dose of       sotalol, the patient will be discharged from the CRC.        A study physician who has undergone specific training will insert the Medtronic Reveal LINQ       ICM according to manufacturer instructions in the CRC. The device will be inserted on day 1.       Briefly, using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a very small 6 to 8 mm skin       incision is made over the left chest. The ICM, which is approximately cylindrical and       measures roughly 2 cm long and 5 mm in diameter, is inserted using a proprietary insertion       tool and a sterile dressing is applied at the end of the procedure. The device will be       programmed to optimize the memory for storing AF episodes. AF-only mode will be activated       and programmed to All episodes to ensure that the shortest possible AF episodes are       detected and stored in the device memory. The patients will be taught how to perform a       CareLink transmission using the small handheld Patient Assistant device. Medtronic       personnel will be on hand to aid in the insertion and initial programing of the ICM as well       as patient education with the Patient Assistant device.        For patients initiating sotalol, no further dose adjustments will be planned after discharge       from the CRC. Patients initiating flecainide will be contacted by telephone 3 to 4 days       after initiation and, if they are tolerating the medication, will be instructed to increase       their dose to 100 mg twice daily.        One-week follow-up visit: All patients will return for a brief visit in the CRC 1 week after       ICM insertion for a wound check and to obtain a 12-lead ECG. A study physician will perform       a brief focused history to assess medication tolerance and compliance. A pill count will be       performed to further assess compliance. Barring any ECG abnormalities or clinical side       effects, patients initiating flecainide will be instructed to increase the dose to the final       dose of 150 mg twice daily.        Three-month follow-up visit and crossover procedures: Patients will be scheduled to return       to the CRC 3 months after study entry. Once a visit is confirmed, each patient will be asked       to stop his or her current AAD 5 half-lives approximately 60 hours prior to arrival to the       CRC. Patients initially taking flecainide will also stop their AV nodal blocker atenolol or       diltiazem at this time. Patients will then present to the CRC and undergo initiation of the       alternative drug using the same procedures that were used at the baseline study visit, with       the exception of the ICM insertion. A full interrogation of the ICM will be performed. A       pill count will be performed to further assess compliance. Patients crossing over to       flecainide will be discharged from the CRC after a 2 hour 12-lead ECG is obtained and       interpreted as normal. Patients initiating sotalol will remain in the CRC for loading and       continuous telemetric monitoring. All patients will be scheduled for a brief follow-up visit       in the CRC one week after crossover to assess for medication compliance and tolerance and       for final titration of flecainide.        Quality of life assessment: Patients will be asked to fill out the AFEQT quality of life       questionnaire at baseline and at the end of each month of the study. The questionnaire at       the end of the 3rd month will be administered just prior to stopping the first study drug.       The validated questionnaire is comprised of 20 questions about AF symptoms with answers       given on a Likert scale. The questionnaire will be provided to the patients in paper format       either in person or by mail, as applicable. A follow-up phone call will be made to each       patient to ensure that the questionnaire is completed and returned.        End of study procedures: Patients will be scheduled for a clinic visit with their primary       cardiac electrophysiologist to coincide with the termination of the study 6 months. A       study physician will also be available to conduct a brief patient interview, pill count, and       ICM interrogation. All pertinent clinical data including AF burden on each AAD, maximal       tolerated dose, and any reported side effects will be given to the primary cardiac       electrophysiologist to aide in clinical decision making about future AAD treatment.        Early study termination, early crossover, and procedures to treat persistent AF: Based on       our prior clinical experience, a proportion of patients 20 to 30% are expected to       experience residual symptomatic episodes of AF while taking either or both study AADs.       Usually these episodes will be less bothersome or lengthy. Patients will be encouraged to       continue the study protocol if possible. However, a smaller proportion of patients might       have intolerable symptoms necessitating an unscheduled change in therapy. The study team       will work with the primary cardiac electrophysiologist to facilitate any necessary change in       therapy. An early crossover to the alternative study AAD will be encouraged over a change to       a non-study AAD when possible. A change in therapy to a non-study AAD or AF ablation       procedure will be allowed when necessary. In addition, if patients acquire persistent AF       during the course of the study, direct current cardioversion will be allowed and will be       coordinated by the study team and the primary cardiac electrophysiologist. AF burden data       for patients deviating from the study protocol will be analyzed using an on treatment       analysis. In other words, the AF burden will be calculated per day that patients are on each       study AAD. Patients will also be allowed to withdraw from the study for personal or other       reasons at any time.        Insertable cardiac monitor management after study termination: At the conclusion of the       six-month study, patients will be given the option to remove or retain the ICM. We       anticipate that most patients and their primary electrophysiologists will opt to retain the       device to allow for continued cardiac monitoring, which is not only useful to gauge response       to AAD therapy but also frequently used to monitor AF recurrence for patients undergoing       catheter ablation. If the ICM is retained, its management, including removal, will be       transferred to the primary electrophysiologist. Patients wishing to have the ICM removed at       the end of the study period will be scheduled for an outpatient visit in the CRC for removal       by a study physician.        Primary end point and its determination: The primary endpoint will be mean AF burden over 3       months as measured by the Medtronic Reveal LINQ ICM system. All patients are scheduled to       remain in the study for 6 months. The FDA-approved Medtronic Reveal LINQ ICM system is able       to continuously monitor the heart through a single-lead ECG and has a specific algorithm       that detects AF by evaluating the irregularity of R-R intervals. The device is able to       correctly classify AF in 96.1% of patients and correctly exclude AF in 97.4% of subjects.       The device is able to monitor the heart for up to 3 years and is compatible with the       Medtronic CareLink Network remote monitoring system. This system allows the treating       physician to download device and diagnostic data through a secure network. Patients transmit       data manually after the device indicates that one of the alert criteria have been met. The       occurrence of symptoms with the AF episode will be recorded, but both asymptomatic and       symptomatic AF will be included in the primary endpoint measurement of AF burden.        For the primary analysis, AF burden will begin to be tabulated after an initial run in       period for each study drug. For patients starting sotalol, the run-in period will coincide       with the first 5 doses 60 hours. For patients starting flecainide, the run-in period will       last until a dose of at least 200 mg per day in divided doses is achieved, unless a       smaller dose is the maximally tolerated dose. Ideally, this will be achieved within 3-4 days       after initiation of flecainide. If, during the course of the study, a patient develops       persistent AF, a cardioversion will be scheduled in coordination with the patients primary       cardiologist or electrophysiologist. The patient will then be switched to the other study       drug. In case of such an occurrence, AF burden will be tabulated using an on treatment       analysis. Conditions for which a patient will be withdrawn from the study and data censored       will be discontinuation of AAD therapy, initiation of amiodarone, AF ablation or AV node       ablation/permanent pacing, loss to follow-up, elective withdrawal from the study, or death.        Blood processing, DNA extraction, and genotyping: Blood samples will be drawn into       ethylenediamenetetraacetic acid EDTA tubes and immediately refrigerated at 4° C. Plasma       will be separated by centrifugation and stored at -80° C. DNA will be extracted from the       buffy coat using a commercially available kit Qiagen Puregene, Valencia, California and       stored at -20° C. Study participants will be genotyped for three common chr4q25 SNPs       rs2200733, rs17570669, and rs3853445 using Sanger sequencing.        7.0 Risks        Risks will be minimized by performing study procedures in the Vanderbilt CRC. A complete       history and physical examination will be performed to ensure that subjects fulfill the entry       criteria as defined. All identifying documents, data, and specimens collected as a result of       this study will be retained by the investigator. Data will be entered into the secure       Research Electronic Data Capture REDCap database. Access to this material will be       available only to the research investigator and his staff. If results of this study are to       be published, only code numbers will be used for identification purposes. Participants will       not be identified by name.        Risks associated with the Medtronic Reveal LINQ ICM: Risks associated with insertion of the       ICM include pain and discomfort, bleeding, bruising, hematoma, infection, and an allergic       reaction to the skin prep or lidocaine used for local anesthesia. There is a very small risk       of long-term discomfort associated with having the device. According to the manufacturer,       the ICM is fully MRI-compatible immediately after implantation.

Risks associated with oral atenolol use: Therapeutic dose of atenolol ranges from 50 mg to       200 mg per day. Common side effects of chronic atenolol therapy include tiredness 26%,       dizziness 13%, depression 12%, cold, tingling, or numbness in the hands or feet 12%,       and shortness of breath 6%. Other common adverse effects of atenolol include slow heart       rate bradycardia, a decrease in blood pressure when going from a lying-down or sitting       position to standing, a spinning sensation vertigo, lightheadedness, diarrhea, and nausea.       We will use a low dose of atenolol 25 mg in this study to minimize the risk of occurrence       of these adverse effects. Rare < 1% side effects of therapeutic doses of atenolol include       an increase in liver enzymes, allergic reactions, headache, impotence also known as       erectile dysfunction, Peyronies disease, worsening of psoriasis, reversible hair loss,       vision problems, dry mouth, Raynauds phenomenon, unexplained rash, and dry eyes. These       adverse effects are not anticipated with a single low dose of atenolol that will be       administered to our volunteers.        Atenolol can rarely cause an allergic reaction <1% that manifests as rash, itching,       swelling, severe dizziness, or trouble breathing. Any subject with a previous history of       allergy or intolerance to beta-blockers will be excluded from the study.

Risks associated with venipuncture: Potential problems related to establishing an       intravenous access include pain, bleeding, hematoma, fainting, and rarely infection at the       venipuncture site.        8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Participants or       Others        All adverse events and incidents of noncompliance with the protocol will be reported to the       institutional review board IRB. A serious adverse event is defined as an untoward medical       occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization, results in       persistent or significant disability, or requires intervention to prevent permanent       disability or death. Other untoward medical occurrences that do not meet the above criteria       will be classified as adverse events. Study personnel who are administering the research       protocol in the CRC will monitor for adverse events, with the assistance of the CRC nursing       staff. All suspected or confirmed adverse events will promptly be reported to the principal       investigator PI, who will collect data on these occurrences. The principal investigator       will report serious adverse events to the IRB, NIH, and any other applicable authority,       within 10 days of the PIs knowledge of the occurrence. Non-serious adverse events and       incidents of noncompliance with the protocol will be reported at the time of annual       continuing review.        9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation        Participation in the study is strictly voluntary, and patients will be able to withdraw at       any time. Following the subjects withdrawal, any samples collected will be destroyed and       not analyzed further, although any analyzed data will be maintained.        10.0 Statistical Considerations        Sample size: This proposed pilot/feasibility study is not expected to be adequately powered       to detect a variable response to AADs based on chr4q25 genotype. Rather, this study will       provide vitally important and currently unavailable data on mean and standard deviation of       AF burden during therapy with the study drugs. These data will then be used to conduct a       formal sample size calculation for the main trial. This study will also examine the       feasibility of the crossover design which, if feasible, will be utilized for the main trial.        Statistical analysis: The primary study endpoint will be AF burden the proportion of time a       patient is in AF and will be calculated for each patient while undergoing therapy with each       study drug. The primary endpoint will be expressed for each study drug as median, 25th       percentile, and 75th percentile. The difference in AF burden while on class I and class III       AADs will be compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data. We will conduct       an exploratory analysis using a linear regression model to detect an association between       genotype and AF burden after adjustment for age and sex. First, we will analyze a model       including separate terms for all three chr4q25 SNPs simultaneously with adjustment for age       and sex. Then we will create a second model that replaces the separate chr4q25 SNP terms for       a combined chr4q25 risk score calculated by adding the beta-coefficients for the genotypes       at rs2200733, rs17570669, and rs3853445 found in the first model. If multivariable analysis       demonstrates the combined chr4q25 risk score and study drug assignment are both       significantly associated with AF burden, they will be tested for a statistical interaction       to determine whether the chr4q25 AF susceptibility locus determines a differential response       to class I and class III AADs. It should be emphasized that this analysis will be       underpowered and over-fitted in this pilot/feasibility study.        11.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues        All research hard copy records will be stored in a locked cabinet within a locked office       with access only to the research personnel. Digitalized ECG recordings will be de-identified       and stored in a password-protected electronic database. Blood samples will be de-identified       and given a specific code number before storage and analysis.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This study aims to enroll 1,000 women who present with AcuteCoronarySyndorme  ACS.       Patients will be identified through screening of all women admitted for chest pain, and       those women with positive cardiac enzymes after operative procedures. After receiving       permission to approach the potential subjects, trained and delegated study personnel will       present the study to the patient. The informed consent process will be completed by the       study coordinator, PI or co-investigator. The patient will have all procedures, risks and       benefits explained and offered time to read and review the informed consent form. They will       be given adequate time to ask questions, consult with family members or primary physicians.       Specifically, written informed consent will be obtained in the emergency department or in       the cardiology ward/unit before the patient is sedated/in the catheterization laboratory. .       When a patient consents to participate in the study, their treatment assignment will be       randomly determined by opening a sealed envelope that contains one of two treatment       strategies. The blinding envelopes will be created by the Biostatistics group and will be       sealed.        Once informed written consent is obtained see accompanying flow chart, each patient will       be randomly assigned to early invasive therapy versus conservative management. All patients       will be administered aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg.       Anti-thrombin therapy unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin according to physician       discretion will be administered intravenously. If anti-thrombin therapy was administered       prior to randomization, this agent will be continued through catheterization and titrated if       necessary to achieve desired effect.        Patients assigned to an early invasive strategy will undergo coronary angiography within 48       hours and have percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting       performed as soon as possible during the initial hospitalization if deemed appropriate. The       choice of intervention or surgery will be determined by the operator according to coronary       anatomy and consistent with current practice guidelines. For example, disease of the left       main trunk, or multi-vessel disease would generally be expected to be referred for surgical       revascularization. Patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention can receive a       glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor i.e. abciximab bolus by intra-coronary or intra-venous       route 0.25 mg per kg, followed by infusion 0.125 µg per kg per minute for 12 hours.       Upfront use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is discouraged. Eptifibatide or tirofiban       can be used instead of abciximab according to operator discretion. Elective percutaneous       coronary intervention on non-culprit vessels, in either study arm, can take place sometime       after the index procedure with the goal to achieve complete revascularization. Such staged       procedures will not be adjudicated as an urgent need for revascularization.        Patients assigned to conservative management will be treated with anti-anginal medications,       as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and other guideline recommended medicines.       Anti-thrombin therapy will be continued for no more than 48 hours. Conservative therapy will       continue during this time, unless the patient has refractory angina, hemodynamic or       electrical instability, left ventricular dysfunction left ventricular ejection fraction <       45%, or significant ischemia on predischarge stress testing. Patients will have an       echocardiogram to determine left ventricle function. Stress testing will be performed by       adenosine SPECT if there is no left ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography. Patients       with any high risk findings, such as refractory chest pain, left ventricular ejection       fraction < 45%, or a large burden of ischemia on stress testing will remain in the hospital       to undergo cardiac catheterization.        Patients in both groups will be treated with lifelong aspirin, 12 months of clopidogrel, in       addition to atorvastatin and other guideline recommended therapies. A shorter duration of       clopidogrel can be recommended in select cases according to treating physician discretion.        Specific data for acquisition:        Protected health information will be accessed by the practitioners normally involved in the       patients care during their hospitalization. Research demographics will be obtained by the       research coordinator by interviewing the patient and by chart review. After hospital       discharge, the research coordinator will contact the patient at specified intervals to       determine if an endpoint has been met. Evidence that an endpoint occurred would require       additional supplemental chart review by the research coordinator.        Patient demographics: age, height, weight, body mass index, medications at randomization,       pertinent medical/surgical/family/social history: for example hypertension,       hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, current tobacco use, history of: prior myocardial       infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02359253","TITLE:       Robot Aided Rehabilitation - Intervention SUMMARY:       The purpose of this study is to address the allocation of therapy resources between the arm       and the hand as well as to examine the benefits of combining passive stretching with active       movement training. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Aim 1 and Hypothesis 1 are included in a separate submission and will not be included in       this protocol and consent        Aim 2. To compare the efficacy of training the arm versus the hand in promoting upper       extremity rehabilitation.        Hypothesis 2: Combining treatment of the arm and hand, even at the cost of decreasing the       total amount of time which can be spent on either, will lead to greater improvement than       focusing primarily on the arm or on the hand alone.        Aim 3. To examine the efficacy of combining passive stretching with active-assistive       resistive training for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand.        Hypothesis 3: Multi-joint intelligent stretching followed by active assistive or resistive       movement facilitated by use of the IntelliArm and X-Glove will improve motor control of the       upper extremity more than standard movement therapy alone.        BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE        Stoke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third leading cause of death killing       160,000 Americans/year in the United States; about 750,000 first ever and recurrent strokes       occur in the United States each year. The economic burden is huge with estimated costs for       medical expenses and lost wages totaling $62.7 billion in the U.S. Stroke is commonly       associated with motor-related disabilities, typically affecting the shoulder, elbow, wrist,       and fingers of the arm simultaneously. Patients may develop spastic hypertonia and reduced       range of motion ROM at multiple joints. Several stereotypical patterns of arm impairment       with multiple joints involved are commonly seen in stroke survivors, including       adducted/internally rotated shoulder, flexed elbow, pronated forearm, flexed wrist, and       clenched fist. Furthermore, impaired arms of stroke survivors commonly develop abnormal       coupling among the multiple joints and among the multiple DOFs e.g. shoulder abduction,       flexion, and rotation at a given joint. Stroke survivors may exhibit a limited capacity to       create independent movements of individual joints or to coordinate the activity of multiple       joints. There is a strong need to treat this hypertonia, involuntary coactivation, and poor       coordination on a frequent basis to reduce spasticity/contracture and increase mobility in       those who have had a stroke. This is the goal of the proposed study.        METHODS Aims 2 and 3 will be addressed through a longitudinal intervention trial. Outcomes       data for each subject will be collected at multiple time points during the study.       Specifically, evaluation sessions will be conducted two times within the two weeks prior to       initiation of therapy Pre 1 and Pre 2 two times within the two weeks after the conclusion       of therapy Post 1 and Post 2, and two months later Follow-up.        Selection of Subjects 72 subacute stroke survivors will be recruited according to the       inclusion and exclusion criteria listed over 5 years.        Intervention Each subject will complete 22 therapy sessions over 6 weeks, in addition to 5       evaluation sessions and 1 screening session. Subjects will be assigned evenly to one of six       groups. Groups are split into 2 conditions based on stretching and 3 conditions based on       target of intervention arm, hand, or both arm and hand. Half of the 72 subjects will be       assigned to the stretching groups and the other half to the no-stretching groups. One third       of the subjects will be assigned to each of the arm-alone, hand-alone, and arm-and-hand       conditions. Arm-alone groups will use the IntelliArm, hand-alone groups will use the       X-Glove, and arm-and-hand groups will use both the IntelliArm and the X-Glove by alternating       sessions with each robot 11 sessions with the IntelliArm, 11 sessions with the X-Glove.       For those assigned to the stretching groups, subjects will complete 30 minutes of passive       stretching with the IntelliArm or X-Glove. For those assigned to the no-stretching       condition, subjects will don the robot according to their group assignment and wear it for       30 minutes preceding the active therapy session. For each group, the initial 30 minutes of       stretching or relaxing will be followed by 45-60 minutes of active therapy with the       IntelliArm or X-Glove depending on group assignment, for a total session time of 75-90       minutes.        The subjects participating in Aims 2 and 3 will be asked to come to our labs at the       Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago to provide informed consent and then complete a       screening, which will take approximately 30 minutes and include a basic questionnaire and       some clinical evaluations. If qualified and enrolled, subjects will complete 5 evaluation       sessions and 22 training sessions.        Training        The training in this study will last for 6 weeks with about 4 visits per week for 22       sessions in total. At the beginning of each training session, the subject will be asked       about any muscle or joint soreness in the hemiparetic arm and hand since the last session.       If the subject has persistent or severe pain, he/she will not continue until he/she feels       sufficiently recovered and the clinician agrees.        IntelliArm Training During the training, the subject will sit upright on a barbers chair       with his/her trunk strapped to the backrest of the chair. The subjects arm, forearm and       hand will be strapped to braces that are connected to a robotic arm; adjustments will be       made to customize the robotic arm for each subject. Once adjustments are completed, the       training will begin, consisting of passive stretching for half of the subjects followed by       active movement therapy. . Each training session should last between one and one and a half       hours.        In the stretching mode, the robotic arm will move the subjects shoulder, elbow and wrist.       Sometimes these joints will be moved one at a time and sometimes they will be moved       together. The joints/DOFs with excessive coupling and/or increased stiffness and the       associated arm postures will be identified and will be targeted for particular attention..       The IntelliArm will stretch the impaired arm under novel multi-joint intelligent control to       stretch the joints forcefully and safely in well-coordinated patterns. On the one hand, for       safe treatment, the stretching velocities will decrease with increased resistance torques at       the multiple joints involved and each joint will be stretched according to its own condition       and the condition of the coupled joints. On the other hand, for effective treatment, the       stretching will not stop until pre-specified peak resistance torque is reached at the       joints/DOFs involved. The stretched arm will be held at the extreme positions for a period       of time to let stress relaxation occur before the joints are moved to other extreme       positions.        In the active training mode, the subject will be asked to move the robotic arm around to       interact with virtual targets and objects. For example, target points will be displayed and       the subject will be asked to move the hand from the current position to the target, while       matching the individual joints angles as well. A circle in the virtual hand needs to overlap       the red-dot targets on the computer monitor for successful match. The IntelliArm can be made       backdrivable by implementing zero-torque control with six-DOF force/torque sensors at each       joint. Alternatively, assistance or resistance can be provided by the IntelliArm to the       impaired arm during the voluntary movement in training to help subjects with arm impairments       reach the target. The level of assistance will be adjusted depending on the severity of the       impairment. Subjects will also move the IntelliArm in order to play computer games such as       catching a baseball or football, and to transport virtual objects from one location to       another in the display. As the user progresses in motor control capability, the workspace       will be increased and resistance instead of assistance may be provided during the movement       to make it more challenging to the patients.        X-Glove Training Two-thirds of the subjects will utilize the X-Glove in their therapy. This       actuated glove provides independent extension force to each digit. Cables run from linear       actuators located on the forearm through cable guides located on the back side of the digits       to the fingertips Fig. 3. A wrist splint keeps the wrist in the neutral position such that       movement of the cable translates into corresponding movement of the digit. Force in each       cable is measured with an in-line sensor, while cable position can be estimated from the       motor displacement. As with the IntelliArm, the X-Glove will be operated in two modes, one       of which will provide stretching while the other provides assistance for hand opening during       active training. For subjects assigned to stretching groups, the X-Glove will first run in a       mode that provides cyclic stretching at a rate of approximately 90 repetitions of passive       range of motion over 30 minutes. The motors will move the digits from an initial flexed       resting posture to the subjects extension limit, as determined by force sensors and range       of motion limits set by the therapist daily. The subject will remain relaxed throughout the       stretching period.        Evaluation and Measurement In an initial screening session, a clinician will check the       subjects health status and conduct clinical examinations in order to determine if the       subject fits the inclusion and exclusion criteria. During the screening session the subject       will participate in several clinical assessments. The screening evaluations will take about       one half hour.        For each evaluation session he/she will be asked to come to our laboratories on the 13th       floor of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. Evaluation of subjects will have       neuromechanical and clinical components; both the neuromechanical and clinical components of       evaluation will take approximately two hours each and occur two times, once per week for the       two weeks prior to treatment, two times, once per week for the two weeks following treatment       and at the 2 month follow-up. .        Protection Against Risk:        A number of safeguards have been implemented. Mechanical/electrical stops will be used to       restrict the motion of the robots to safe ranges. Velocity limits will also be set to       restrict the speed of the movement. Joint angle, velocity, and force will be monitored       continuously to ensure they fall within the appropriate range. Exceeding the thresholds will       result in motor shut-down. Additionally, the motors can be turned off at any time using an       accessible on/off switch to protect from discomfort or potential injuries. The IntelliArm       and X-Glove have previously been used safely with a number of stroke survivors. Rest breaks       will be provided as needed during therapy to prevent excessive muscle soreness and fatigue.        A cast saw will be used to remove the fiberglass cast used in evaluations. Improper use of       the saw could produce a burn. Project staff has been trained in the operation of the saw and       proper procedures to follow. Adhesive used to secure the surface electrode could irritate       the skin. The skin will be carefully prepared before applying the electrode and then cleaned       when the electrode is removed.        Specific to TMS, although rare instances of seizure have been reported when long trains of       high frequency excitatory TMS were applied, these events have not been reported when       recommended guidelines originally published in 1996 and updated by Rossi et al. 2009 Clin.       Neurophysiol. 120:2008-2039, have been followed. The parameters proposed in this study are       well within these published safety guidelines, and individuals who have suffered a stroke       are one of the most commonly requited populations for TMS studies. Providing they have never       had a seizure and do not meet any of the other exclusion criteria listed above, they are a       clinical population to which TMS can be safely applied.        Data Analysis:        To relate and find the relationship between physiological data and functional performance       the data will be evaluated using a biomechanics data analysis, b correlation and principle       component analysis, c regression, d Rasch analysis, and e structural equation modeling.       Physiological data obtained from the IntelliArm e.g. abnormal coupling of between the       joints/DOFs, passive workspace and active workspace, multiple joint DOF/stiffness will be       analyzed to describe and characterize the arm impairment. The physiological data will also       be compared to the therapist-rated data WMFT, ARAT, CAHAI, FMUE to investigate their       relationship. To determine the proper physiological measurements in rehabilitation of stroke       and relate them to functional performances, correlation analysis and principal component       analysis will be conducted as initial steps to find which physiological variables have high       correlations with functional measures and cluster together as similar indicators. Those       potential indicators will be filters for a data reduction procedure. The selected data will       then be used in a multiple regression analysis to predict functional outcomes at the       activity level assessed by WMFT, ARAT, and CAHAI and participation level assessed by the       datalogger with adjusted person information and environmental factors serving as       categorical variables. Rasch analysis will be used to evaluate the item difficulty hierarchy       and item fit to link subjects functional ability level with specific functional tasks,       which allows us to find the clinical potential thresholds/cut-off points if there is a       consistent pattern between exists the physiological data and functional measures.       Furthermore, an ICF model will be evaluated using structural equation modeling, which can       test a set of regression equations simultaneously and exam the relationship among the       impairment ability, participation variables with the personal and environmental factors       taken into consideration. Two months after the 22 sessions training, the subject will be       asked to return to our lab for a follow-up evaluation. The same evaluations as described       above will be done in this session. The subjects, who participated in the training, will       fill out a form, which may be sent to them by email, about his/her health status and injury       history three month after the training period to evaluated changes in performance in the       hemiparetic arm.

Many potential mechanisms, such as       weakness, motoneuronal hyperexcitability, and elevated passive impedance, can contribute to       the impairment, thereby making it difficult to discern where best to focus treatment. The       objectives of this study are to quantify the progression of neuromechanical properties       throughout the upper extremity during recovery from stroke.        The aim of this study is to examine neuromechanical properties throughout the entire upper       extremity in stroke survivors over a period of 6 months and throughout the progression from       the acute to the subacute to the chronic phases of recovery. The researchers hypothesize       that excessive local and cross-coupled stiffness, heteronymous reflexes, and diminished       individuation and proprioceptive acuity will be present among multiple DOFs in the upper       limb. The stiffness and spasticity will increase with time post-stroke. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Stoke is the leading cause of adult disability and the third       leading cause of death killing 160,000 Americans/year in the United States; about 750,000       first ever and recurrent strokes occur in the United States each year. The economic burden       is huge, and stroke is estimated to cost the United Stated $62.7 billion in medical expenses       and lost wages. Stroke is commonly associated with motor-related disabilities. Motor       impairments in stroke survivors typically affect the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers of       the arm simultaneously. Patients may develop spastic hypertonia and reduced range of motion       ROM at multiple joints. Several stereotypical patterns of arm impairments with multiple       joints involved are commonly seen in patients with neurological impairments, including       adducted/internally rotated shoulder, flexed elbow, pronated forearm, flexed wrist, and       clenched fist. Furthermore, the impaired arm of a stroke survivor commonly develops abnormal       coupling among multiple joints and among multiple DOFs e.g. shoulder abduction, flexion,       and rotation at a given joint. Stroke survivors may lose independent movement of individual       joints and appropriate coordination among joints. There is a strong need to treat       stereotypical deformity, impairment of hypertonic arms and multiple involved joints       simultaneously on a frequent basis to reduce spasticity/contracture and increase mobility in       those who have had a stroke, which will be address in the proposed study.        METHODS The aim of this study will be addressed through a longitudinal evaluation of stroke       survivors over the first 6 months following their stroke. Specifically, upper extremity       control and neuromechanical properties will be measured at 7 different time points over the       six months.        Selection of Subjects Twenty-four stroke survivors will be recruited over the 5 years of the       study. All participants will be in the acute phase of recovery at time of enrollment from a       first-ever focal unilateral lesion ischemic or hemorrhagic as diagnosed by MRI or CT.       Participants will be recruited from the inpatient population at RIC and from referrals from       Northwestern Memorial Hospital.        Subjects will be asked to come to our labs at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago to be       consented and participate in an initial screening. Designated study personnel will obtain       consent and complete the screening visit. If qualified and enrolled, the subject will be       asked to complete 7 evaluation sessions at times indicated in Outcome Measures Section.        Subject participation will last for 6 months total. If the subject has persistent or severe       pain, he/she will not continue until he/she feels sufficiently recovered enough and       continued participation is deemed appropriate by a clinician.        Evaluation and Measurement In an initial screening session, after the subject has been       consented, a clinician will check the subjects health status and conduct clinical       examinations in order to determine if the subject meets the inclusion and exclusion       criteria. During the screening session the subject will participate in several clinical       assessments. The screening evaluations will take about one half hour.        If the subject qualifies for the study, they will participate in evaluation sessions at 7       time points spaced throughout the study. For each evaluation session he/she will be asked to       come to our laboratories on the 13th floor of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.       Evaluation of subjects will have neuromechanical and clinical components; the       neuromechanical components of the evaluation will take approximately two hours and the       clinical components will also take approximately two hours.        Neuromechanical evaluations The neuromechanical portion of the evaluation the subject will       sit upright comfortably on a sturdy barbers chair, with the trunk trapped to the backrest.       The arm, forearm and hand will be strapped to their corresponding braces with the relevant       axes of the IntelliArm aligned with the arm at the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers. The       position of the elbow, wrist, and finger servomotors can be adjusted for different arm,       forearm and hand lengths. The subjects arm will be moved at different speeds including one       joint at a time and multiple joints simultaneously. Similarly, the subject will be asked to       move his/her arm one joint at a time and multiple joints simultaneously. During the       evaluation sessions, signal from the subjects muscles called electromyography EMG will be       recorded to monitor activities of the subjects upper limb muscles. The skin over the muscle       belly will be cleaned with an alcohol pad and may be shaved by disposable razors.       Self-adhesive electrodes will be placed on the cleaned sites and connected to the instrument       and computer. The electrodes are just used for recording the signal generated by the muscles       and the subject will not feel any shocks during the evaluations. Non-invasive       electroencephalography EEG electrodes may be attached on the scalp to record brain       activity signals. A video or some photos may be taken as an option to evaluate the movement       patterns during the evaluations.        In diagnosing the multi-joint and multi-DOF biomechanics changes, the IntelliArm will       operate both passive and active modes. In the passive mode, the multi-joint arm robot will       move the shoulder, elbow, and wrist of the impaired arm of stroke survivors throughout the       ROMs both simultaneously and individually in well-controlled patterns with multi-axis       torques and positions measured at the should, elbow and wrist simultaneously. In the active       mode, the patient will move the impaired arm voluntarily and the multi-joint and multi-DOF       dynamic properties will be measured at the shoulder, elbow and wrist simultaneously.        Measures of stiffness and of hyperexcitability of the long finger flexor muscles, namely       spasticity and relaxation time, will be made using techniques we have implemented       successfully in the past. Spasticity of finger muscles will be measured as the reflex       response to imposed rotation of the metacarpophalangeal MCP joints of the four fingers. A       servomotor will create either fast MCP rotation 300°/s to invoke a stretch reflex or slow       constant-velocity rotation 10°/s to measure nominally passive stiffness. Wrist orientation       will be fixed with a fiberglass cast which is subsequently clamped to a table to prevent arm       translation. MCP angle, angular velocity, and torque are recorded for analysis of       spasticity. EMG recordings will be obtained with surface electrodes Bagnoli, Delsys, Inc.,       Boston, MA from selected superficial muscles such as extensor digitorum communis EDC and       flexor digitorum superficialis FDS. Relaxation time will be quantified by examining FDS       activity. The subject will be instructed to maximally grip a dynamometer upon hearing an       audible tone. The subject should then relax his grip as quickly as possible after hearing a       second tone. The relaxation time is defined as elapsed time from the second tone to the       point at which the FDS magnitude returns to the baseline level + three standard deviations.        Clinical evaluations During clinical evaluations subjects will undergo a battery of       standardized clinical assessments. These assessments require subjects to complete functional       movements and tasks using their arms and hands.        Potential additional evaluations Additionally, subjects may be asked to wear a small motion       tracker datalogger for up to 6 hours. This will record the subjects arm movements in       his/her own living environment, thereby providing a measure of real-world activity, taking       personal and environmental factors into consideration. The datalogger consists of motion       sensors, that attach to the subjects arm via straps, and a small recorder that can clip on       to the belt. The subject will take the datalogger home. After wearing it for the time       described above, the subject will take the datalogger off as instructed during the       evaluation session in our lab and return it at the next training session.        As an option, changes in corticospinal activation may be evaluated using transcranial       magnetic stimulation TMS in some subjects, provided the subjects meets       inclusionary/exclusionary criteria, such as no implanted cardiac pacemaker or metal implants       in the head/face. TMS is used to evaluate corticomotor excitability. It is delivered via       Magstim BiStim stimulator Magstim Co, Dyfed, UK that will be used to deliver stimuli via a       figure-of-eight coil 70mm windings. Responses will be examined in bilateral muscles using       surface electrodes. While stimulating over the affected or unaffected hemisphere, motor       evoked potentials MEPs are recorded over the muscles contralateral to the affected or       unaffected hemisphere. The participants are seated comfortably during the evaluation. Foam       earplugs are inserted into the patients external ear canals to attenuate the stimulator       discharge sound. Surface electromyography electrodes are placed over the muscles bilaterally       for recording TMS MEP responses.        Protection Against Risk:        A number of safeguards have been implemented. Mechanical/electrical stops will be used to       restrict the motion of the robots to safe ranges. Velocity limits will also be set to       restrict the speed of the movement. Joint angle, velocity, and force will be monitored       continuously to ensure they fall within the appropriate range. Exceeding the thresholds will       result in motor shut-down. Additionally, the motors can be turned off at any time using an       accessible on/off switch to protect from discomfort or potential injuries. The IntelliArm       and the hand jig have previously been used safely with a number of stroke survivors. Rest       breaks will be provided as needed during therapy to prevent excessive muscle soreness and       fatigue.        A cast saw will be used to remove the fiberglass cast used in evaluations. Improper use of       the saw could produce a burn. Project staff has been trained in the operation of the saw and       proper procedures to follow. Adhesive used to secure the surface electrode could irritate       the skin. The skin will be carefully prepared before applying the electrode and then cleaned       when the electrode is removed.        Specific to TMS, although rare instances of seizure have been reported when long trains of       high frequency excitatory TMS were applied, these events have not been reported when       recommended guidelines have been followed. The parameters proposed in this study are well       within these published safety guidelines, and individuals whove suffered stroke are one of       the most commonly requited populations for TMS studies. Providing they have never had a       seizure and do not meet any of the other exclusion criteria listed above, they are a       clinical population to which TMS can be safely applied.        Data Analysis:        To relate and find the relationship between physiological data and functional performance,       the data will be evaluated using a biomechanics data analysis, b correlation and principle       component analysis, c regression, d Rasch analysis, and e structural equation modeling.       Physiological data obtained from the IntelliArm e.g. abnormal coupling between the       joints/DOFs, passive workspace and active workspace, multiple joint DOF/stiffness will be       analyzed to describe and characterize the arm impairment. Similar measures will be obtained       for the fingers to characterize hand impairment. We will especially examine how these       measures change over time. Curves will be fit to the data to approximate functions       describing the changes in neuromechanical measurements over time. Similarly, the scores from       the clinical evaluations WMFT, ARAT, CAHAI, FMUE will be assessed over the time course of       the recovery period.        The potential relationships among the physiological data and the clinical data are of       special interest. To determine the proper physiological measurements in stroke progression       and to relate them to functional performances, correlation analysis and principal component       analysis will be conducted as initial steps to find which physiological variables have high       correlations with functional measures and cluster together as similar indicators. Those       potential indicators will be filtered through data reduction procedures and then used in a       multiple regression analysis to predict functional outcomes at the activity level assessed       by WMFT, ARAT, and CAHAI and participation level assessed by the datalogger with adjusted       person information and environmental factors serving as categorical variables. Rasch       analysis will be used to evaluation the item difficulty hierarchy and item fit to link the       subjects functional ability level with specific functional tasks. This will help to find       the clinical potential thresholds/cut-off points if there is a consistent pattern between       the physiological data and functional measures. Furthermore, an ICF model will be evaluated       using structural equation modeling, which can test a set of regression equations       simultaneously and exam the relationship among the impairment ability, participation       variables with the personal and environmental factors taken into consideration.        Data Collection and Record Keeping:        Designated study personnel will enter de-identified data into a password protected computer.       Paper records of any kind collected during evaluation and treatment sessions will be stored       in a locked cabinet. Data will be kept for 3 years after the end of the study and then       destroyed by a secure document destruction service.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02372461","TITLE:       Randomized Trial of Amoxicillin Versus Placebo for Fast Breathing Pneumonia SUMMARY:       The relative benefits and risks of antibiotic therapy in WHO defined fast breathing       pneumonia in pre-school children in resource limited settings are controversial both at an       individual and public health level. Most infections are viral or self-limiting and       non-selective drug treatment has contributed to the global epidemic of antibiotic       resistance. There is no high quality trial evidence in managing children with fast breathing       in community settings and the WHO itself has called for evidence on which to update       guidance. The investigators proposed non inferiority trial comparing standard antibiotic       treatment with placebo in poor urban slum settings in South Asia to address this deficit. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Pneumonia is a major cause of illness and death in children in low-income countries. With a       view to decreasing death from pneumonia, the World Health Organization and UNICEF developed       the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness IMCI algorithm which simplifies management       of common childhood illnesses such as pneumonia and diarrhea into different levels of       severity for determining the most appropriate case management by primary healthcare       providers. Many pneumonia cases are categorized as non-severe pneumonia defined as fast       breathing above the specified age cut-off for respiratory rates. As there is incomplete       information regarding the cause of this type of pneumonia from primary care settings,       treatment guidelines by WHO are dictated by culture information from hospital pneumonia       cases which are different in severity and cause. Current WHO guidelines advocate the use of       oral antibiotics for fast breathing pneumonia. However, it is postulated that most fast       breathing pneumonia not requiring hospitalization is of viral etiology, thus does not       require antibiotic treatment. The cost of antibiotic treatment for all children with       pneumonia is high; an estimated US$ 200 million in South Asia & sub Saharan Africa alone.       Since more than 60% of pneumonia is classified as non-severe fast breathing, this puts a       strain on already under-sourced programmes in low-income countries. Giving antibiotics where       they confer no benefit also puts the child at risk of side effects and increases the risk of       antimicrobial resistance in the community. This uncertainty forms the basis of the proposed       study. Investigators propose to show in a clinical trial that the outcome of children       diagnosed with WHO defined fast breathing pneumonia is similar regardless of whether they       receive antibiotics or not. This study will be conducted in five primary health care centers       located in low income communities of Karachi, Pakistan, with extensive trial experience.       Children identified to have fast breathing without any danger signs will be randomized to       receive either three days of the WHO recommended oral antibiotic amoxicillin 250mg/5ml       using WHO weight bands or matching placebo a drug that will taste and look like the       amoxicillin but will not have an active ingredient by a study physician working at the       primary health center. The assignment of the antibiotic amoxicillin or placebo to a child       will be done using a computer generated randomization list in a manner that at the end of       the trial, there are equal numbers of children in both arms of the trial. Based on the       statistical calculations for sample size, investigators need to assign 1214 children to       receive amoxicillin and the same number of children to receive placebo. All children will       receive the antibiotic or placebo under supervision of the primary health care physician in       the morning. Evening doses will be delivered by locally hired Community Health Workers       CHWs visiting the children at their home. All children will be assessed again on day 3 by       a study physician to see if the childs presenting sign of high respiratory rate has       resolved or not. All children with persistently high respiratory rate and/or development of       a new clinical sign indicating illness progression will be labeled a treatment failure.       There will invariably be some children with treatment failure in both the treatment arms;       investigators hypothesize that there will be equal number of treatment failures in both the       groups i.e. around 5%. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  History of cough or difficult breathing < 14 days observed or reported AND            -  Respiratory rate ≥ 50 breaths per minute in children 2 to <12 months on two              consecutive readings by independent physicians OR respiratory rate ≥ 40 breaths per              minute in children12- 59 months on two consecutive readings by independent              physicians AND            -  Written informed consent by a legal guardian          Exclusion Criteria:            -  Previously enrolled in study            -  Pedal edema            -  History of hospitalization in last two weeks            -  With severe lower chest wall in-drawing            -  Known asthmatics,TB or other severe illness            -  Antibiotics taken in last 48 hours            -  Bulging fontanel            -  Congenital heart disease            -  Any surgical condition requiring hospitalization            -  Out of catchment area            -  Any general danger sign as defined by WHO: Stridor when calm; hypoxia SaO2 < 90% in              air ; inability to feed; persistent vomiting after three attempts to feed the baby              within ½ hour; convulsions; reduced conscious level ");

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This is an exploratory vaccine trial to evaluate immunogenicity of a non-licensed dosing       schedule and route of administration for a currently FDA licensed rabies vaccine for       pre-exposure prophylaxis against rabies infection. The goal of this study is to characterize       the immune response and persistence of immunity to a shortened dose schedule and intradermal       ID administration, relative to the current licensed dosing schedule of the rabies vaccine       3 dose 0, 7, 21 days IM. Rabies virus is endemic throughout the world due to high rates       of both wild and domestic animal rabies and the risk to deployed military in endemic areas       is considerable. Currently the commonly supported pre-exposure prophylaxis regimen for       rabies, in the United States is comprised of three, 1.0 ml intramuscular IM injections of       the human diploid cell vaccine HDCV or purified chick embryo cell PCEC rabies vaccine on       days 0, 7, and 21 or 28. Modified, two and three dose schedules of intradermal ID       injections of 0.1 ml of HDCV and PCEC are utilized outside the US. These two and three dose       intradermal schedules share a similar safety and immunogenicity profile to intramuscular       vaccinations and are easily boosted at one year after vaccination. A death, from rabies, of       a US Soldier returned from Afghanistan underscores the importance of rabies pre-exposure       prophylaxis for soldiers and the need to evaluate the safest, most effective means of       vaccinating large deploying forces. While the current three dose, 1 ml IM rabies series is       effective, a shortened, equally effective vaccination series with significantly smaller dose       per injection would greatly improve the logistics and cost associated with universal or even       targeted coverage of deploying soldiers. Evaluation of a shorter, smaller-dose, pre-exposure       vaccination series for rabies is the goal of this study.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02379728","TITLE:       Ghana PrenaBelt Trial SUMMARY:       Every day in Ghana, 47 babies are stillborn SB and 232 babies are born with low       birth-weight LBW - many of whom will die in infancy or suffer lifelong consequences.        Sleeping on the back during pregnancy has recently emerged in scientific literature as a       potential risk factor for SB and LBW. In fact, one of the earliest studies to demonstrate       this link was conducted in Ghana by investigators on this protocol.        When a woman in mid-to-late-pregnancy lies on her back, her large uterus compresses one of       the major veins that delivers blood back to her heart and may completely obstruct it. This       may result in less blood being returned to her heart and less blood being pumped to her       developing fetus. Such changes may negatively impact the growth of her fetus and, along with       some other risk factors, may contribute to the death of her baby.        The investigators have developed a device, PrenaBelt, to significantly reduce the amount       of time a pregnant woman spends sleeping on her back. The PrenaBelt functions via a simple,       safe, effective, and well-established modality called positional therapy.        The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the PrenaBelt on birth-weight and       assess the feasibility of introducing it to Ghanaian third-trimester pregnant women in their       home setting via an antenatal care clinic and local health-care staff. Data from this study       will be used in effect size calculations for the design of a large-scale, epidemiological       study targeted at reducing LBW and SB in Ghana and globally. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Introduction:        According to the WHO, stillbirth SB is defined as fetal death at gestation ≥28 weeks or       weight ≥1000g. In addition to the loss of life for the stillborn baby, parents whose baby is       stillborn must cope with the psychological grief of losing their baby, which results in       markedly increased mortality in bereaved parents when compared with non-bereaved parents.        Low birth-weight LBW is defined as a weight less than 2500g at birth. LBW is a significant       contributor to SB, and infants with LBW are 20 times more likely to die in the first year       than heavier babies. Although LBW babies constitute only about 15% of live births, they       account for 60-80% of neonatal deaths. Neonatal deaths death within the first year of life       account for 40% of all deaths under the age of five years. LBW also accounts for significant       morbidity such as cognitive impairment, and chronic diseases later in life. LBW arises       through short gestation preterm birth or in-utero growth restriction, or both.        Women in Ghana suffer from one of the highest perinatal mortality rates in the world. Every       day in Ghana, 47 babies are stillborn and 232 babies are born with LBW - many of whom will       die in infancy or suffer lifelong consequences. As such, Ghana urgently requires inexpensive       interventions to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality - assisting pregnant Ghanaian       women to avoid sleeping on their back might be one such intervention.        Background - Maternal Position:        In obstetrics, it is well-known that when a pregnant woman assumes the supine position       laying on her back during the day, maternal cardiovascular parameters and/or fetal       oxygenation are altered, occasionally causing significant fetal heart rate changes,       particularly during labor. However, until recently, there has been little evidence on the       effect of supine position during sleep in pregnancy. Recently, three studies have suggested       that maternal sleep position may be a risk factor for SB and LBW. This is significant given       that the majority of third trimester pregnant women spend up to 25% of their sleep time       supine. In the Auckland Stillbirth Study, the population attributable risk PAR for       non-left sleep position to SB was found to be 37%, which is greater than the PARs of the       three most important modifiable risk factors for SB obesity, advanced maternal age, and       smoking combined. In an African population, investigators on this protocol found that       supine sleep during pregnancy was an independent predictor of LBW OR, 5.0; 95% confidence       interval CI, 1.2-20.2; P=0.025 and SB OR, 8.0; 95% CI, 1.5-43.2; P=0.016, when       controlling for covariates maternal age, gestational age, parity, and the presence of       pre-eclampsia. Notably, LBW was found to mediate the relationship between supine sleep and       SB. Currently, there is much interest and follow up research occurring worldwide, with a       growing body of evidence regarding the detrimental effects of supine sleep position on       pregnancy outcomes.        One proposed model is that the maternal supine position during sleep is a stressor that       plays a causative role in LBW and SB via compression of the abdominal aorta and inferior       vena cava aortocaval compression, resulting in negative sequelae. The investigators       hypothesize that by mitigating this stressor, they may protect the fetus from LBW or SB.        Background - Maternal Device:        Given the emerging data suggesting that supine sleep may play a role in LBW and SB and the       high perinatal mortality rate in Ghana, a simple intervention may allow the investigators to       improve fetal outcomes.        Some pregnant women sleep with many pillows supporting their body, including a pillow behind       their back to avoid the supine position. Asking women to sleep on their left increases the       percentage of left sided sleep to approximately 60% of the night; however, this may come at       a cost of a slightly reduced sleep duration, perhaps due to women feeling they need to make       a conscious effort to maintain a certain sleep position.        Hence, a simple, low-cost, and easily-implemented device has been developed for use by       pregnant women to mitigate this risk factor. The investigators anticipate that using this       device will remove the need for the woman to make a conscious effort to avoid the supine       sleeping position. The device name is PrenaBelt. The PrenaBelt is currently at the       prototype stage of development, and as such, this proposal is a proof-of-concept/feasibility       project.        The PrenaBelt is a belt-like, positional therapy device designed specifically for pregnant       women. While the PrenaBelt does not prevent the user from lying on her back during sleep, it       is expected to significantly decrease the amount of time she spends in this position via the       mechanism of positional therapy. Positional therapy is a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive,       long-established, safe, and effective intervention for preventing people with       positional-dependent snoring or mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea from sleeping on       their back - a position that exacerbates their condition.        The PrenaBelt is worn at the level of the waist. By virtue of its design and position on the       users body, the PrenaBelt affects subtle pressure points on the back of the user when she       lies on her back. These subtle pressure points activate her bodys natural mechanism to       spontaneously reposition itself to relieve discomfort, thereby reducing the amount of time       she remains on her back during sleep. The PrenaBelt is also designed for adjustability and       comfort.        The investigators have designed an electronic Body Position Sensor BPS that can be       securely integrated into a pocket on the PrenaBelt. The BPS will record body position of the       user left, right, prone, supine. The BPS is for research purposes only.        Study Design:        The feasibility technical, operational, cultural, efficacy, acceptability, and compliance       of the PrenaBelt intervention in the target population during the third trimester of       pregnancy in an antenatal care clinic and home settings and the effect of PrenaBelt       treatment on birth weight will be evaluated via a sham-controlled, double-blind, randomized       controlled trial. Preliminary data will be collected for the design of a future,       large-scale, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the       PrenaBelt intervention in improving pregnancy outcomes in a resource-limited setting.        A small cohort of participants from the treatment and control groups will be randomly       selected to use BPSs throughout the third trimester of pregnancy. Each BPS participant in       the treatment group will be matched to a BPS participant in the control group using BMI       normal, overweight, obese and age within 5 years; 2.5 years each side as matching       variables and BPS data will be compared. These data will serve as preliminary objective       evidence of PrenaBelt usage and effect on maternal sleeping position during the third       trimester of pregnancy in the target population and setting.        Potential Harms:        This study is minimal risk. Participants in this study are at no greater risk of harms when       completing the activities of this study than those risks they encounter in their everyday       life.        The PrenaBelt, sham-PrenaBelt, and Body Position Sensor devices are non-invasive medical       devices of Health Canada Class I designation. Pregnant women typically sleep with many       pillows supporting their body, including a pillow behind their back to avoid the supine       position. The PrenaBelt is a positional therapy device that may assist pregnant women to       avoid supine sleep. Positional therapy devices have been shown to be safe and approved for       use by humans by the US Food and Drug Administration. In addition, maternal body pillows,       regular pillows, and pelvic belts lumbar support have been used by pregnant women during       sleep without reports of serious adverse effects for the mother or neonate [Victoria Pennick       and Sarah D Liddle, Interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in       pregnancy Review, The Cochrane Collaboration, London, Review 2013].        Participants in both the intervention and control groups may experience discomfort while       learning to sleep with the PrenaBelt/sham-PrenaBelt, which theoretically may lead to delayed       onset of sleep, arousals from sleep, and loss of sleep. Participants will be instructed how       to, and told that they can, remove the PrenaBelt/sham-PrenaBelt and discontinue use at any       time without penalty if they become too uncomfortable.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02381340","TITLE:       ACE Stapler Sub Study SUMMARY:       Obesity and its associated conditions have reached epidemic proportions. Estimates are that       about one third of the adults in the United States have obesity. At this moment there are       many therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity. But, efficacy of most treatment       options are limited and so far surgical intervention has been proven to be the only strategy       to overcome severe obesity. However, bariatric surgery has limitations and risks, which       might be minimized by non-incisional endoscopic procedures.        BaroSense developed a new device, called the Articulating Circular Endoscopic ACETM       Stapler, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. It is a trans-oral procedure, which       intends to reduce the ability of the stomach to expand by creating plications in the region       of the fundus and greater curvature. In contrast with other bariatric surgery it is       endoscopically performed, reversible and if it fails most future surgical options are still       open.        The main study Open, prospective study to evaluate the safety and preliminary       effectiveness of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler for the treatment of obesity, multicenter study       MUMC+, AMC and St. Antonius, accepted by MEC AMC seeks to determine the safety and       efficacy of this plicating system for patients with severe obesity.        In this sub-study we want to unravel the exact mechanism and provide more information about       the efficacy of the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler. Therefore we will measure changes in various       parameters that are known to affect weight loss and metabolism, before and after gastric       plication by using the BaroSense ACE™ Stapler in overweight subjects these parameters       will only be measured in patients at MUMC+. These parameters are post-prandial satiety,       food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour towards food, food       intake, satiety hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.        Objectives:        Aim of the present study will be to assess the effect of the BaroSense ACE™ stapler on       postprandial satiety, food-reward and related brain signalling, gastric emptying, behaviour       towards food, food intake, hormone release, microbiota composition and inflammatory markers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Complications such as surgical site infections, deep wound infections, prosthetic graft       infections, and non-infections problems such as wound dehiscence continue to cause       significant morbidity for patients undergoing arterial reconstruction for peripheral       arterial disease. Patients undergoing leg bypass surgery for limb salvage are at particular       risk due to their medical problems such as diabetes and renal failure and location of       incisions along the groin area. Surgical site infections SSI are estimated to occur in       5-40% of patients undergoing arterial bypass for lower extremity arterial occlusive disease.       The in-hospital SSI rate is 5% across the Vascular Study Group of New England, a regional       quality improvement registry. Factors contributing to wound infections include patient       factors such as advanced age and comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes and renal       insufficiency and surgical factors including the division of local lymphatics in the groin,       placement of a prosthetic graft and inherent difficulty in keeping an incision across the       groin crease covered, dry and protected.        Despite the use of standard sterile technique and perioperative preventative antibiotics       infections these complications continue to cause patient morbidity. In addition these       complications increase the intensity and cost of care with an added estimated expense of       $11,000 per incident. New strategies are needed to reduce these complications. Negative       pressure wound therapy has the potential to prevent a variety of wound complications. One       innovative strategy that has shown promise is the application of the Prevena dressing system       over the closed surgical incision. The dressing consists of a sterile sponge that is placed       over the incision followed by a plastic adhesive covering that is used to secure it to the       skin forming an air-tight seal. The sponge is then connected by tubing to a vacuum that       applies negative pressure to the closed system. This allows fluid to drain from the wound       and into a container connected to the dressing. When compared to surgical dressing with       sterile gauze and tape, the Prevena dressing system has the advantages of providing a       sterile barrier, reducing tension on the incision, and removing fluid from the incision.       Please refer to patient brochure for an illustration and further description of the Prevena       dressing system.        Negative pressure wound therapy has been applied for many years to enhance healing of a       variety of open wounds including pressure wounds, diabetic ulcers, venous stasis ulcers,       open infected surgical to traumatic wounds and burns with variable success. The treatment is       based on evenly distributed local negative pressure applied to the wound surface. The open       wound is filled with a sponge and covered with an occlusive dressing which is then connected       by means of a set of suction tubes to a device which applies negative pressure on the       surface of the wound that can be adjusted either cyclically or continuously. The fluid from       the wound is collected into a container. The benefits of negative pressure wound therapy       have been reported to include removal of infectious material, reduction in edema and       improved perfusion to tissue.        The success of negative pressure wound therapy with open wounds has been extrapolated to       intact surgical incisions. Recently a negative pressure wound therapy dressing has been       developed for use over closed surgical incisions.        The investigators aim to study the ability of a negative pressure wound therapy dressing to       prevent wound complications after vascular surgery involving incisions in the groin.        The aim of this study is to compare the Prevena dressing system to standard surgical       dressing in patients undergoing leg bypass surgery for vascular disease involving their legs       in a multicenter randomized trial. All other aspects of the procedure are the part of       standard vascular surgery practice. Patients undergoing vascular surgery with an incision in       the groin will be treated with a standard gauze dressing or the Prevena wound management       system which will be applied in the operating room and left on the wound for 5-7 days.       Follow-up visits to assess the surgical wound are already standard of care. The two groups       will be compared based on the primary and secondary endpoints listed in these documents.       Quality of life will be compared by a patient survey and a cost analysis will be performed. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1. Age ≥ 18            2.

Utilization of a monitor       with a rapid response and easy clinical applicability which can demonstrate effective       sympathetic block would increase efficiency within the procedure suite and also serve to       function as an objective endpoint for the evaluation of sympathetic blockade in future       research.In current clinical practice, the most commonly used monitoring methods are       clinical observations of sympathetic blockade, skin temperature monitoring, pulse pressure       monitoring and any combination of these monitoring methods. The skin temperature and pulse       pressure may increase after sympathetic block. However, changes in the skin temperature and       pulse pressure often demonstrate an unpredictable or delayed response. Confounding       variables, such as ambient temperature, coexisting vascular disease, use of other vasoactive       medications may contribute to inconsistencies in the temperature or pulse pressure       responses.        Normal sympathetic activity stimulates muscarinic receptors in the periphery that       subsequently stimulate the sweat glands to secrete and fill with sweat containing sodium and       other electrolytes. The electrolytes present in the sweat increase the electrical       conductance while decreasing the electrical resistance at the skin level.        The real-time changes in skin conductance indices can be monitored at the skin level, by use       of non-invasive electrodes attached to the skin similar to EKG electrodes. A computer       program analyzes the data and produces a real-time graphic and numeric data demonstrating       the skin conductance response.

Investigators think that South Asians capacity to store fat safely       under the skin is lower than Europeans, so they start to store fat around internal organs       and in liver and muscle, and at lower body weights than Europeans. These increased levels of       internal fat storage are thought to increase risk of diabetes.        The purpose of the study therefore is to investigate whether there are differences with       weight gain and weight loss in fat storage, fat cell function and metabolic risk factors, in       South Asians compared with Europeans. Investigators will compare South Asian and European       men at the start of the study, after they have gained about 7% body weight, and again after       they have lost 7-15% body weight from peak weight to see how gaining and losing weight       affects fat storage within the body and the function of fat cells. Investigators will also       assess the effect of weight gain and weight loss on metabolism, fitness and risk factors for       diabetes and heart disease. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       South Asians have about five times the risk of adult onset diabetes high blood sugar than       Europeans and nearly one in five South Asian men in the United Kingdom have the disease.       Diabetes is a serious disease that can lead to a number of adverse health consequences       including heart disease, kidney disease and blindness and accounts for about 10% of all       healthcare costs in the UK. Obesity is strongly linked to diabetes risk, but the adverse       effect of getting fatter on diabetes risk is much higher in South Asians than Europeans. The       purpose of this study is to understand why this is the case. When humans put on weight       initially this fat is stored under the skin subcutaneous fat. This is relatively safe.       However, when the capacity of this under skin storage is exceeded, fat is stored internally       within the tummy area visceral fat and in organs such as the liver and muscle, which is       less safe and increases diabetes risk. Investigators think that South Asians capacity to       store fat safely under the skin is lower than Europeans, so fat is stored internally and in       liver and muscle at lower body weights than Europeans. The purpose of this study is to       investigate whether this occurs and why. To do this investigators will compare a group of       South Asian and European men and see how gaining and losing weight affects fat storage       within the body and the function of fat cells. Investigators will also assess the effect of       weight gain and weight loss on metabolism, fitness and risk factors for diabetes and heart       disease.        The study will include healthy men of normal weight aged between 18-45 year and of either       white European or South Asian both parent of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladesh or Sri Lankan       origin ethnic origin.        Body weight will be altered by initially gaining weight and then losing weight. To do this       participants will initially have to eat more food for 4-6 weeks and then go on a diet       combined with exercise for 12 weeks. Participation in the study will last around 5½ months       in total.        During the study pictures of body fat stores will be taken using an MRI scanner, a       biopsy/sample of tummy fat will be taken to look at the fat cells and physical fitness and       body metabolism the way the body deals with sugar, insulin and fat will be measured. These       measurements will be done at three different times: before gaining weight, once weight is       gained, and after losing weight and back to original weight. The measurements will give a       detailed assessment of the changes in the body when gaining or losing weight.        The benefits of taking part in the study are receiving detailed feedback about fitness       levels, body fat, dietary intake, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar and level of       insulin resistance. Feedback about the overall study findings will also be provided.        In addition, the knowledge gained from participation may benefit people who are at risk of       diabetes in the future by increasing our understanding of why South Asians are at increased       risk of developing diabetes. It will also help guide future research investigating how to       reduce this increased risk through lifestyle changes and may also help direct the       development of medicines to prevent and treat diabetes groups at increased risk of the       disease.        Possible disadvantages of the study are gaining 7% of body weight over 4-6 weeks. This is       likely to temporarily induce negative metabolic changes. However, investigators are also       supporting losing this weight and hopefully more in the weight loss phase of the study.       There is no evidence that short-term weight gain of this nature causes any long-term adverse       effects. Longer-term weight gain however is associated with an increased risk of diabetes,       cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. It is therefore important that investigators       ensure participants return to original weight at the start of the study. Taking fat biopsies       carries a small risk of minor bruising or an infection. Good sterile practice reduces this       risk of infection and application of ice and pressure to the biopsy site reduces the risk of       bruising. Blood sampling via the cannula may cause minor bruising or an inflammation of the       vein. Some participants may feel faint when they give blood. One of the exercise tests will       be at a maximal level and the possibility exists that, very occasionally, certain changes       may occur during or shortly after the test. They include abnormal blood pressure, fainting       or a change in the normal rhythm of the heartbeat. There is a small possibility that taking       part in this study will reveal a health problem that patients already have such as high       cholesterol or high blood pressure. If such a problem is revealed, investigators will ask       permission to inform the participants General Practitioner to receive clinically       appropriate follow-up care.        This study is running for ~2.5 years from March 2015 and is based at the University of       Glasgow. The study is being funded by the European Commission as part of the European       Medical Information Framework EMIF, called EMIF-Metabolic. This research will help       investigators to better predict who is likely to be at risk of developing diseases such as       diabetes and to develop new medicines to prevent and treat these diseases.

Various pain assessment tools, such as       NRS have been developed and validated to objectively monitor and treat pain. There are       certain patient populations, in whom, the current pain assessment tools cannot be used       effectively due to communication problems such as cognitively impaired patients. In the US,       the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations JCAHO has made it       mandatory to monitor and treat pain. In the absence of reliable pain assessment tools that       would objectively measure pain, there is also risk of under treatment and overtreatment of       pain that may lead to negative outcomes.

This       technology has been termed asleep DBS and is performed with the patient under general       anesthesia. Intraoperative imaging is utilized to verify the stereotactic accuracy of DBS       electrodes placement at the time of surgery. Because stereotactic accuracy and surgical       safety is the surgical endpoint, there is no need for the patient to be awake during the       procedure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Traditional DBS is performed without general anesthesia with the patient awake. Local       anesthetic is used to numb the skin and tissue where the incision is made, and the patients       are given mild sedatives to alleviate anxiety and discomfort. Essential tremor ET patients       undergo intra-operative test stimulation to refine the lead location and ensure the absence       of sustained side effects. This can result in multiple brain penetrations during lead       placement, and the entire procedure may last anywhere from 4-6 hours on average. The concept       of being awake during brain surgery provokes significant anxiety and fear in some patients.        Recently, there has been increasing interest in performing DBS under general anesthesia,       where the stimulated targets are located anatomically i.e. on MRI rather than       physiologically via microelectrode recordings and intra-operative test stimulation. This       technology has been termed asleep DBS and is performed with the patient under general       anesthesia. Intraoperative imaging is utilized to verify the stereotactic accuracy of DBS       electrodes placement at the time of surgery. Because stereotactic accuracy and surgical       safety is the surgical endpoint, there is no need for the patient to be awake during the       procedure.        If asleep DBS produces clinical results equivalent to awake DBS surgery, the possible       advantages include shorter surgical time, improved patient comfort, better access to DBS for       patients, and cost savings for the hospital.        To date August 2011 - September 2014, 157 patients have undergone asleep DBS surgery and       141 patients have undergone traditional awake DBS surgery. ET patients constitute 76 of the       total surgeries - 50 patients underwent awake surgery and 26 underwent asleep surgery. The       safety and efficacy of the two approaches to DBS surgery have been equivalent, and we are at       a position of equipoise with regard to what to offer to patients. To date, there have been       no randomized, controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy and functional outcomes of       the two DBS methods for patients with the diagnosis of Essential tremor. The purpose of the       proposed study is to demonstrate that the functional outcomes of the asleep technique are       not inferior to those reported for traditional awake DBS technique. The primary data       points for this study will include three month functional outcomes using accepted outcome       metrics for ET, including an objective tremor rating scale Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating       Scale, a tremor Activities of Daily Living ADL questionnaire Bain and Findley Tremor ADL       scale, and a tremor quality of life questionnaire : Quality of Life in Essential Tremor       Questionnaire [QUEST]. Parkinson Meter and Life Pulse tremor readings two iPhone       accelerometer applications will also be collected. . Patients who elect to participate in       this trial will undergo a routine pre-operative neurocognitive evaluation consisting of the       following routine evaluative tests: Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Mattis Dementia Rating       Scale 2nd Edition, Wechsler Abbreviate Scale of Intelligence 2nd Edition; Wechsler Memory       Scale 3rd edition, Digit Span, Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test, Trail Making Test,       Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Animal Naming, Boston       Naming Test, Wechsler Memory Scale 4th Edition, Logical Memory, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test       - Revised, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised, Hooper visual Organization Test,       Judgment of Line Orientation, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Epworth       Sleepiness Scale. The subjects will then be randomized to 2 groups by using random numbers       in an envelope system. We anticipate that 120 total patients will need to be enrolled in       this pilot study 60 awake, 60 asleep, and thus the numbers 1-120 will be placed in       envelopes. An odd number will correspond to the awake DBS procedure, and an even number will       indicate an asleep DBS procedure. The null hypothesis is that asleep DBS results in inferior       tremor ratings 3-months after surgery when compared to awake DBS. Our secondary aim will be       to evaluate any cognitive changes associated with DBS surgery selection awake vs. asleep       in ET patients. Current standard of care for patient selection in DBS focuses primarily on       the evaluation of motor symptoms and currently there is no guidance for how a patients DBS       surgery selection awake vs. asleep would impact on subsequent neurocognitive function.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis, is a type of neurological disorder       characterized by spastic muscles in the neck that is largely underdiagnosed despite its       progression to disability during midlife. Cervical dystonia occurs in at least 0.390% of the       United States population in 2007 390 per 100,000. Symptoms commonly include stiffness,       pain, headaches, difficulty swallowing, fatigue, and difficulty walking. The current       standard treatment is intramuscular botulinum toxin injection every 90 days. The effect of       the botulinum toxin increases gradually, and then it decreases until there is little to no       effect at 90 days post-injection. The purpose of the proposed research is to determine if       Osteopathic manipulative medicine OMM used in combination with the standard treatment of       botulinum toxin intramuscular injections improves motor function and quality of life amongst       people with cervical dystonia.        The investigators propose to use Vicon 3-dimensional gait and posture analysis to determine       the biomechanics of subjects with primary cervical dystonia to compare with full body       complaints from a standard spasmodic torticollis/cervical dystonia questionnaire as well as       the osteopathic structural exam. These measures will be assessed before and after four OMM       treatments. In addition, the investigators propose to use osteopathic manual medicine along       with botulinum toxin injection to improve the subjects pain and motor function as evaluated       by Vicon 3-dimensional gait and posture analysis and questionnaire regarding quality of       life. Preliminary case reports suggest that Osteopathic manipulative medicine without       botulinum toxin injections improved pain, posture, gait, and quality of life in four adult       subjects as well as improved head tilt in two children two- and five-years old. The       central hypothesis is that osteopathic manual medicine will significantly improve the range       of motion, motor function, and quality of life of subjects with primary cervical dystonia.        Aims:        Aim I. To determine 3-Dimensional gait and posture biomechanics of subjects with untreated       primary cervical dystonia while walking, and to investigate the effectiveness of OMM in       treating abnormal biomechanics in these subjects.        Hypothesis I: People with cervical dystonia have similar abnormalities in posture and       structural exam that significantly alters their gait and full body motor function that can       be significantly improved with OMM.        Experimental approach: Motor function will be assessed by Vicon 3-Dimensional analysis using       34 of the subjects while walking will depict stride length and arm swing on each side of the       body as well as the posture of the shoulder and pelvic girdle with reference to the coronal,       transverse, and sagittal planes. Quality of life will be assessed by the Cervical Dystonia       Impact Profile CDIP-58 questionaire. Four weekly OMM diagnosis and treatment will be done,       and then, motor function and quality of life will be reassessed. Total participation in the       study is expected to last for 5-7 weeks.        Expected outcomes: The spasticity in the neck will affect motor function of the whole body.       There will be decreased stride length and arm swing on the side of the body with the neck       muscle spasm. The shoulder girdle and pelvis will be continuously rotated around a vertical       axis the same direction as the head in reference to the feet and direction of walking. The       shoulder and pelvic girdles will be tilted such that they are closer together on one side       than the other side due to side-bending of the torso. We also expect that there will be an       indirect relationship between age and motor function. OMM is expected to significantly       improve motor function and quality of life.        Significance: The impact of the neck muscle spasticity on full body biomechanics of subjects       with primary cervical dystonia is not well understood, and the results can be used to       improve assessment of function as well as management of the disorder.        Aim II. To determine whether osteopathic manual medicine used during the first four weeks       following botulinum toxin intramuscular injection will significantly improve the joint range       of motion, motor function, and quality of life of subjects with primary cervical dystonia .        Hypothesis II: Osteopathic manual medicine will improve the range of motion of the neck,       symmetry of posture and gait, and quality of life of subjects with primary cervical       dystonia.        Experimental approach: Subjects being treated with botulinum toxin injections will be       evaluated with a standard spasmodic torticollis form to be filled out by physician,       cervical dystonia questionnaire regarding quality of life, and Vicon 3-Dimensional gait and       posture analysis before and after four weekly treatments with OMM n≥8 for comparison with       subjects in a no-OMM control condition n≥ 8.        Expected outcomes: Subjects will have improved quality of life in regard to head and neck       symptoms, pain and discomfort, upper limb activities, walking, sleep, annoyance, mood, and       psychosocial functioning. Subjects will have improved joint range of motion and motor       function.        Significance: Although physicians specializing in osteopathic manual medicine treat patients       with various types of dystonia, the effectiveness of osteopathic manual medicine in treating       primary cervical dystonia is not established, and thus, osteopathic manual medicine is not       recognized or recommended as adjunctive therapy. The botulinum toxin is injected into       spastic neck muscles. However, there is no adjunctive procedure recommended for treating the       rest of the symptoms associated with the illness. 3-dimensional characterization of motor       function has been used in children with cerebral palsy and generalized dystonia before and       after surgical intervention, and using a similar method may demonstrate how OMM can prevent       people from becoming disabled.

Despite its high efficacy, due tovariant       anatomy of cavotricuspid isthmus CTI, i.e. location of right coronary artery, pouches, the       achievment of complete bidirectional block across the CTI is sometimes chalenging.       Intracardiac echocardiography ICE is a very usefull tool for on-line vizualization of the       anatomy of the atria and also for the location of catheter position on CTI during ablation.       If the routine use of ICE is associated with easier atrial fluter ablation is not clear.        Methods: One hundred consecutive patients indicated for typical atrial flutter ablation will       be enrolled into the study. The patients will be randomized into group A ablation with use       of ICE and B ablation without ICE. The ablation will be done in both groups by two       diagnostic catheters 10-pole positioned in coronary sinus and 20-pole halo catheter       positioned in the right atrium and radiofrequency ablation catheter. The end-point of the       ablation is the achievment of the bicidrectional block across the CTI. The end-points of the       study are 1 the total length of the procedure, 2 the fluoroscopy time and 3 the ablation       time. The safety end-point is clinically significant bleeding from the groin due to       additional puncture for ICE catheter.        Discussion: We hypothesize the use of ICE wil shorten the radiofrequency energy delivery,       fluoroscopy time and the length of the procedure without increasing the bleeding. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Introduction Radiofrequency ablation RFA of typical atrial flutteru is the most successful       method for treatment of atrial flutter. The acute peri-procedural efficacy is more than       95%. 1 Typical atrial flutter circuit uses the area between inferior caval vein and       tricuspid anulus, so a RFA of typical flutter is performed by providing a linear lesion from       inferior caval vein to tricuspid valve this area is called as cavo-tricuspid isthmus. The       recurrence of atrial flutter after ablation, which are caused by non-transmural RF lesion,       are in less than 10% of cases. 2 During atrial flutter ablation, typically three       electrophysiological catheters are used. Two catheters are diagnostic one 10-pole inserted       into coronary sinus and the other 20-pole inserted in the right atrium with the distal tip       laterally from the cavo-ticuspid isthmus. The third is ablation catheter, inserted in the       CT isthmus. The location of all three catheters is monitored by fluoroscopy and by the EP       signals on catheters. Also the ablation catheter during the ablation is monitored by       fluoroscopy and by the signals on the catheter.        Despite its high efficacy, the RFA of atrial flutter can be sometimes very difficult. The       most difficulties are done by anatomical differences in patients. 3, 4 In the area of CTI,       the rudimentary Eustachian valve can be present, which can hide the effective ablation of       the CI tissue. Moreover, deep pouches can be present in the TI area, which, if unrecognized,       can present the area of insufficient ablation. Both of them, Eustachian valve or pouches,       are not visible by fluoroscopy. In rare cases, a complete block in the CTI are is not       achieved, typically due to some anatomical difficulties. Furthermore, this anatomical       obstacles can lead to prolonged fluoroscopy time to find the location of conduction in CTI       rea, more RF energy delivery and prolonged procedure time. Longer ablation time increases       the risk of ablation such as right atrial perforation. Next possible anatomical obstacle       is the right coronary artery which can effective prevent sufficient ablation due to its       cooling effect. 5 Intracardiac echocardiography ICE is done by using intracardiac echo       probe. The probe is inserted in the right atrium, which allows the visualizing of the CTI       area. 6, 7 ICE is used for AF ablation in some centers, but its effect has never been       validated in the randomized study. The aim of our study is to assess whether routine use of       ICE can lead to decrease fluoroscopy time, decrease need for RFA delivery i.e. number of       ablations and a decrease procedure time. On the other hand, the safety endpoint will be to       assess whether a routine use of ICE is not associated with higher rate of complications. We       hypothesize, the use of ICE will shorten fluoroscopy, ablation and procedural time without       increased number of complication        Patients and methods:        Consecutive patients indicated due to standard criteria i.e. according to the guidelines of       the European Society of Cardiology for atrial flutter ablation will be enrolled. Exclusion       criterion will be the absence of written informed content and a history of recent femoral       vein thrombosis < 6 months.        Randomization: 1 to 1 for ICE vs. non ICE RF ablation will be done routinely, as it is done       in the center. In the Ice group, ICE probe will be inserted through the left femoral vein in       the right atrium TH ICE will be used for the visualization of the anatomy of CTI area and       the visualization of the catheter during RF delivery. In case of the non-ICE group, RFA will       be done without ICE catheter, as it is done routinely now. In both groups, the diagnostic       catheters 10-pole CS and 20-po in the RA and ablation catheter will be the same. In the       non-ICE group, the location of the catheters will be assessed by fluoroscopy and by signals       on catheters. At the end of ablation, total fluoroscopy time, the number and length of       ablation and the duration of procedure will be calculated. On the day and two weeks after       the procedure, the bleeding complication will be assessed.        End-points: the major end-points will be: 1 total procedure duration min 2 fluoroscopy       time 3 the number of ablations 4 the total duration of RF energy delivery. Major safety       end-point will be complication from left femoral ICE access. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  indication for atrial flutter ablation          Exclusion Criteria:            -  history of recent femoral vein thrombosis within last 6 months ");

Pregnancy and delivery related complications are a major health problem globally. Events       during labor such as excessive bleeding, uterine rupture, emergency cesarean delivery; other       instrumental deliveries and anesthesia problems are situations that potentially may lead to       severe outcomes for the mother and child.        Diabetes, anemia and hypertensive disorders may also complicate both the pregnancy and       delivery.        Between 60-80% of women delivering their first baby need suturing due to perineal tears       tears located to the area between the vagina and anus. Superficial perineal tears rarely       cause long-term problems, but often lead to pain and discomfort immediately after birth.       Deeper or severe perineal tears, involving the anal sphincter, may influence the womans       quality of life. This is mainly due to long-lasting pain, discomfort and sexual dysfunction,       and the fact that obstetric anal sphincter tear is the main cause of anal incontinence.       Recent clinical intervention studies have shown that the incidence of severe obstetric       perineal tears may be reduced by 50-70% by introducing a bimanual support technique of the       perineum. In these studies all midwives and gynecologists were trained in the bimanual       support technique. When it comes to training in new medical techniques in general, some       studies have shown that use of animated instructions on mobile phones may be a good       alternative to the more traditional hands-on or bedside teaching methods. In a global       perspective, it is important to study the efficacy of mobile units for transferring of new       knowledge, especially for use in resource constrained settings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The main aim is to study the incidence of major delivery complications and perineal injuries       during vaginal delivery in Palestine. A manual support technique of perineum will be       introduced.          1. To assess the incidence of perineal tears, episiotomies, obstetric anal sphincter            injuries and major obstetric complications in Palestine in a multicenter study            involving three hospitals on the West Bank and three hospitals in Gaza.          2. To assess the present treatment of obstetric anal sphincter tears in Palestine.          3. To study whether intervention with bed-side training of the hands-on the            Norwegian-Finnish support technique reduce the incidence of obstetric anal sphincter            tears.          4. To study whether training by animated instructions of the same hands-on support            technique, using smart phones or tablet computers, reduce the incidence of obstetric            anal sphincter injuries.          5. To compare results between the two different training methods.          6. To study midwives and doctors attitudes towards hands-on training compared to            training by animated instructions. The main aim is to assess the incidence of perineal            injuries during vaginal delivery in Palestine, and to introduce a manual support            technique of perineum. Norwegian intervention studies have shown that the incidence of            obstetric anal sphincter injuries OASIS can be reduced by 40-70% by improving            hands-on delivering techniques. The reduction was achieved by educating all staff on            the delivery unit, implementing a new hands-on delivering technique. Some previous            research has shown that non-interactive training by animated instructions or videos in            emergency obstetric care, might be equally effective as conventional interactive            hands-on training. However, the effectiveness of training by animated instructions            compared to conventional training programs remains to be assessed properly. By            performing a multicentre intervention study, the investigators will explore the effect            of interactive hands-on training on the incidence of perineal injuries. Likewise the            investigators will study effect of non-interactive training by animated instructions.            Three hospitals on the West Bank WB and three in Gaza have accepted to participate.            The investigators will also assess whether attitudes towards training methods influence            the results.        The steps of observation, training and interventions in this study:          1. Intervention 1 1 month:             Education in diagnosis and repair of perineal injuries and implementation of system to            register data.          2. Observation 1 6 months:             Data-registration baseline.          3. Intervention 2, 6 months:             First part:             In all participating hospitals, the training in hands-on manual perineal protection            will be communicated by animated instruction accessible on tablet computers and smart            phones. The information and instructions how to perform the manual perineal protection            is transferred for the users by instruction video showing the method as an animation            with voice-over in Arabic and English. All 6 hospitals implement this intervention            simultaneously.             Second part, the stepped wedge approach:             After one month the first hospitals starts with the traditional bedside hands-on            training of the midwives and physicians. Norwegian midwives and obstetricians support            this training. The traditional bedside training then starts stepwise in the 6            hospitals, one month after each other, in a stepped wedge model.          4. Observation 2 12 months:        There will be a one year observational period where all data is collected. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  all midwives and physicians working on labor ward in the participating hospitals.            -  all women giving birth in the participating hospitals.            -  both genders are included in the staff, and among the newborns          Exclusion Criteria:            -  no exclusion criteria, the study aim is the education of the staff, and hospitals are              compared as units.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02447731","TITLE:       The Effects of Sound Energy on Pulmonary Gas Exchange SUMMARY:       Study of the effects of sonic pressure oscillations on pulmonary gas exchange with added       dead space. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Sound waves are used in various industries to accelerate the process of mixing or separating       fluids gases/liquids. We have proved that certain sound waves can safely improve gas       exchange in the lung of rats through accelerating gas diffusion inside their airways and       alveoli. Now we want to see if similar sound waves can improve gas exchange in humans.        The device which creates the sound waves is a sonic pressure oscillator capable of making       sound waves similar in loudness and frequency to loud human singing or screaming. These       waves are mainly in the frequency range of 50-500 Hz Hertz, oscillations per second with       intensity of 85-105 dBs deci Bells, unit of sound pressure intensity.        We performed two bench top studies and witnessed the ability of sound waves to augment gas       diffusion. In a pilot study in rats we showed a safe and significant improvement in       pulmonary gas exchange under influence of sound energy. The effects of sound waves on gas       exchange in a human subject, the principle investigator PI, was also analyzed in a       metabolic test with promising results. A clinically significant improvement in the PIs       pulmonary gas diffusion was also noted in a DLCO diffusing lung capacity for carbon       monoxide test. On yet another test, artificially enlarged pulmonary dead space study, the       PIs transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures PtcCO2 & PtcO2 were measured and       results were indicative of presence of desired and safe effects of particular sound waves in       pulmonary gas exchange. The above mentioned studies support the rationale, objectives, and       methodology of the proposed studies.        Our human studies will be composed of a primary and a secondary part. In the primary part,       the sound waves are not introduced into the subjects lungs directly and they are rather       delivered into an open end cylinder while the subjects breathe the air from the closed end       of the cylinder. The sound intensity will be kept in the range of 95-105dB.        In the second part of the studies, the sound waves of lower intensity 85-95dB are directly       introduced into the subjects lungs while the subjects are going through 1 a metabolic test       and 2 a lung diffusion capacity DLCO test. The results of these tests will be compared to       the subjects baseline test results without sound waves.        In both parts of the study, the subjects nostrils will be clamped by ordinary plastic nose       clamps as they will be asked to hold a mouthpiece and breathe through it.        In the primary part, sound waves of 95-105dB will be delivered into a 16 L liter frustum       conical cylinder. The frustums wider base is open to room air but its smaller base is       closed. A 2x20 cm tube will connect the closed end of the frustum to the mouthpiece. The       subjects will be breathing in and out of the narrower closed base of the frustum through       the mouthpiece for 3 minute cycles followed by 3 minute cycles of breathing fresh room air.       The subjects PtcCO2 and PtcO2 will be measured with the frustum held in various spatial       orientations in regard to its open base which will be 1 vertical upward +90 degrees with       horizon, 2 horizontal 0 degrees, vertical downward -90 degrees, and tilted to -45       degree angles. This test will take at least 6x4=24 minutes, and not more than 30 minutes for       each subject. Then same tests will be done with sound energy introduced into the frustum.       Total time for studying each subject will be approximately 48-60 minutes.        Secondary part of the study is composed of two sections. In the first section, diffusion       capacity of the lungs will be measure while the sound waves are being played by the       transducer and delivered via a mouth piece into the subjects oral cavity. The sound waves       will be travelling down the pulmonary airways and into the alveoli. An examiner will listen       to the chest wall to make sure that the subject is allowing the waves to travel down the       airways without obstructing the path to the sound waves by inadvertently holding the tongue       up or holding breath. Said mouth piece is connected via a Y-connecter to the DLCO machine       and the tube which delivers the sound waves. The duration of exerted sound effect will be       only 9 seconds as per protocol of a routine DLCO testing. This period coincides with the       time when the subject is taking a deep breath and holding it for 9 seconds. Lung diffusion       capacity of the subjects will be measured and compared with soundless test results. Although       the test uses very small amount of carbon monoxide CO as the tracer gas but the amount is       considered negligible and quite safe. This test has been done in humans routinely for many       years with no known discernable side effects. It has been approved by FDA many years ago.       There is an abundance of medical literature regarding the safety and methods used in DLCO.       There are also multiple YouTube videos showing how DLCO is done. We will encourage the       participants to watch these videos before the studies. The subjects will be sitting       comfortably on a chair and holding the mouth piece in their mouths and breathing the room       air. They can easily interrupt the test at any time by simply taking the mouthpiece out of       their mouths.        In the second section, subjects will go under metabolic tests where their exhaled oxygen       O2 and carbon dioxide CO2 are measured with and without sound effects. Metabolic tests       have been approved by FDA for many years and are generally considered very safe. During the       test, the participants breathe from the mouth piece with their nostrils clamped. Breathing       gases will be provided by connecting the mouth piece to a tube which usually has a base flow       of room air 40L/min or more. In order to show oxygenation improvement via sound energy we       will have to create a suboptimal respiratory environment and artificially induced hypoxia.       Mild hypoxia is generally well tolerated by healthy humans although it might make the       individual feel short of breath and tachypneic. We will add nitrogen to the supplied air to       bring the fraction of inhaled oxygen FiO2 down to 17.5% which correlates breathing at an       altitude of 7500 feet approximately 2250m, or similar to a ski resort, except that we       dont ask our subjects to get involved in vigorous exercise like skiing, and the test is       only ~20 minutes. The lowered FiO2 will bring the subjects pulse ox SpO2 down to 92-94%       which is generally considered safe and well tolerated by all normal human subjects with no       cardiopulmonary conditions. The resultant mild and transient respiratory alkalosis has no       clinical significance as it only involves a 20 minute test and the pH imbalance would be       buffered naturally without inducing any electrolyte abnormalities.        The acoustic transducer, as mentioned briefly earlier, is a simple sound wave generator and       is composed of a tone generator usually a computer, an electronic amplifier, an acoustic       transducer similar to an ordinary loudspeaker, and a funnel and tubing system that directs       the sound waves into the subjects mouthpiece. Its function is very similar to standing in       front of a loudspeaker and letting the sounds penetrate into the mouth/nose and down the       pulmonary airways except that in order to protect the ears and intensify the sounds a funnel       is used to capture the waves and direct them into the oral cavity via a tube. The device is       made, tuned, and calibrated by the principal investigator. It can produce tones from 20 Hz       to about 11 KHz with useful intensities ranging from 65dB to a maximum of 110dB. The simple       device has been successfully used in rats and a human PI without any discernible side       effects.        For more detailed description of the methodology and results of our previous studies please       refer to the attached documents with the referenced literature.        Data Collection:        During the first part of the study, data with subjects PtcCO2, PtcO2, heart rate,       respiratory rate, minute volume, and blood pressure will be logged onto a spread sheet and       saved on password protected computers.        Lung diffusion capacity variations under the influence of sound vibrations will be measured       and recorded using a DLCO machine at the respiratory department of LLUMC. Data will also be       saved on password protected computers using encrypted MS-Excel in addition to the memory of       the DLCO machine. During the metabolic tests, inhaled and exhaled concentrations of O2 and       CO2 will be continuously monitored along with subjects heart rate, breath rate, pulse       oxymetery, blood pressure, general comfort level of the subject and his/her clinical       wellbeing. The encrypted and password protected data will be collected on Microsoft       Spreadsheets for statistical analysis by a biostatistician.        RISK AND INJURY:        Human ears are particularly prone to damage by loud sounds. Ear pain or discomfort can       happen at sound levels as low as 110dB but painful sound levels are generally considered to       be in the range of 125-135dB. Other organs tolerate sound wave much better and tissue damage       normally does not occur in sound intensity levels less than 160-170dB. Sound intensity will       be monitored and recorded during the studies. The intensities will always be kept to below       105dB which is significantly below any harmful levels considering the fact that sound       pressure levels are measure in logarithmic scale.        During the metabolic tests, the subjects pulse oximetry will be kept above 92% to avoid any       ill effects. These levels are very well tolerated by humans and ordinarily physicians do not       supplement any oxygen to patients at these levels. Very brief hypoxia with hypercapnia will       happen during the frustum test when the frustum is held at held at +90 degree position as       the SpO2 will plummet to upper 70s to lower 90s in about 3 minutes which is the limit of       this test. We will halt the test before the 3 min landmark if a subjects SpO2 went below       80%. The brief and transient hypoxia and hypercapnia is well tolerated. A medical doctor       will be present at all times whenever the tests are running. A thorough medical exam       immediately before the tests will secure safety of the subjects as well.        Metabolic studies and DLCO tests have been done routinely for many years/decades and are       generally considered very safe. The amount of inhaled carbon monoxide used as a tracer gas       in DLCO is significantly below any toxic levels. These tests have been approved by FDA for a       long time and are considered safe even in patients with pulmonary disorders.        BENEFITS:        The studies do not have any direct or immediate benefit to the subjects participating in the       study. It has been anticipated that sound waves may help decrease incidence and severity of       ventilation induced lung injury or VILI to an extent yet to be measured. The main reason       behind this postulation is that addition of proper sound waves to breathing gases will       enable us to effectively ventilate lungs with lower FiO2 and/or less mean airway pressure       Pmaw compared to the currently available technologies. It is known for a long time that       high FiO2/Pmaw are the two major predictors of VILI. It is also anticipated that the outcome       of cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR and many acute or chronic pulmonary disorders such as       COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, restrictive lung disorders, acute       lung injury, pneumothorax, RDS, and some other conditions may improve through use of proper       sound waves.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Experimental evidence repeatedly demonstrated that the shock patients can use substrates       other than glucose to sustain increased activity, including lactate.Increased lactate can be       the consequence of anaerobic metabolism, i.e., the formation of lactate in the presence of       low oxygen. However, emerging evidence demonstrated that in patients with sepsis increased       lactate seems predominantly non-hypoxic/ischemic and rather the consequence of increased       glycolysis. Utilization of lactate as an alternative fuel may be an adaptive response to       maximize energy function and limit substrate reduction.Uptake of exogenous lactate has       indeed been demonstrated after traumatic brain injury and acute heart failure in humans.        The investigators assume that administration of supplemental lactate significantly       contributes to energy metabolism in septic shock, which can have beneficial help for septic       shock resuscitation.

Low Dose Femoral Nerve Blocks For Early Rehabilitation After Knee Arthroplasty SUMMARY:       Recently, several articles have suggested or reported that Adductor Canal Blocks ACBs       offer adequate or equal analgesia and may promote better performance in early rehabilitation       following Total Knee Arthroplasty TKA when compared to the more commonly used Femoral       Nerve Block FNB. A common feature of these studies has been the use of moderate to high       concentration local anesthetics e.g. 0.2% or 0.5% Ropivacaine respectively which when       injected by a large motor nerve will inevitably cause weakness. However, the practice at our       institution has long been a continuous femoral nerve block CFNB with a lower concentration       local anesthetic 0.0625% Bupivacaine. Over the past several years the investigators have       performed several thousand CFNBs using this technique which has offered the advantage of       minimal motor weakness and adequate analgesia.        The primary goal of this study is to determine if our established practice of using a low       concentration continuous FNB inserted about 5cm caudal to the groin crease the apex of the       femoral triangle using a low infusion rate of 2ml/hr is comparable to the emerging practice       of inserting a Continuous Peripheral Nerve Block CPNB in the anatomic adductor canal AC       - infusing at 4ml/hr. A secondary goal is to study the effect of cumulative volume of local       anesthetic infused through a FNB when at a rate of 2ml/hr compared to a rate of 4ml/hr in       the 48-hour postoperative period.        Definitions of the location of the adductor canal are debated heavily in literature, but       they seem to agree that the middle 1/3 of the thigh contains the proximal AC while the       distal 1/3 of the thigh contains the adductor hiatus - the terminal end of the AC. Our study       will require placement of the continuous ACB no more distal than 20cm cephalad to the       superior pole of the patella due to placement prior to surgery and the need to keep the       dressing out of the operative field. The CACB catheter will also not be placed any more       proximal than 20cm distal to the ASIS. In addition to other exclusion criteria, these       measurements will create an exclusion for patients with an iliac-to-patella distance less       than 40cm. Iliac to Patella distance IPD will be measured at the pre-operative interview       on the day of surgery with a measuring tape. External palpable landmarks of the Anterior       superior iliac spine and the superior pole of the patella will be used.        The primary outcome is based upon the ability to perform rehabilitation exercises       postoperatively to the extent that criteria for discharge can be met. The primary outcome       measured is the time at which a patient gains the ability to successfully perform a 75-feet       unassisted walk. On the Day of Surgery DOS, prior to any walking attempt, a secondary       outcome measure will be to perform a 5-second sustained straight leg raise. Other secondary       outcomes will be the number of days admitted prior to discharge, and average pain scores on       DOS, POD#1, and POD#2. The Day of discharge will also be used as a secondary outcome.       Earlier discharge is becoming a goal of almost all healthcare systems to minimize costs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The three arms are as follows:          1. The control group; Continuous Femoral Nerve Block - Low Dose CFNB-LD will be patients            randomized to our standard therapy comprised of a low dose/concentration Continuous            Femoral Nerve Block inserted approximately 5cm distal to the groin crease with a rate            of 2ml/hr.          2. Higher dose HD CFNB; - block placed in same location as CFNB-LD but with a higher            dose rate of 4ml/hr. This higher rate could afford more pain control but may cause more            quadriceps or hip flexor weakness.          3. Continuous Adductor Canal Block CACB group will have a catheter inserted 20-30cm            proximal to the superior pole of the patella, and an infusion rate of 4ml/hr, but with            similar dressing to make it appear like those in group 1 and 2.        Acute Pain/Regional anesthesiologists and fellows will be performing all research procedures       in the same locations that the investigators routinely perform regional nerve blocks: our       preoperative holding area adjacent to the operating room suites at University of Pittsburgh       Medical Center UPMC - Passavant.        All three groups have a set rate that will not increase. There also will be no bolus orders       given on the floors, however IV and PO medications will be available to decrease discomfort.       These medications are ordered to be given upon request PRN; upon patient request.       Down-regulation of doses will also not be allowed as that would cause uncertainty as to       which regimen may contribute most to postoperative weakness. The only adjustment allowed       will be to turn off the nerve block infusion completely on POD #1 if a dense motor block of       the quadriceps or iliopsoas hip flexor exists, as this condition does not facilitate       participation in rehabilitation exercises. The frequency of early-removal of nerve block       will be recorded for all three groups.        CFNB groups Continuous Femoral Nerve Block placement: The skin of the right or left groin       will be sterilized and draped under sterile conditions, the femoral nerve will be identified       using ultrasound just below the inguinal crease and the local anesthetic will be infiltrated       subcutaneously. The needle is inserted at the lateral edge of the probe and directed toward       the nerve using ultrasound assistance. When in proximity of the nerve, 15ml of 0.2%       ropivacaine will be injected through the needle with repeat aspiration every 5 ml. The nerve       block catheter will be placed 3-5 cm past the needle tip and secured with steri strips and       bio-occlusive dressing.        CACB group Continuous Adductor Canal Block placement: The distance from the ASIS to the       superior pole of the patella will be measured and the distance recorded. This       Iliac-to-Patella distance IPD will be divided into proximal and distal halves, and the       halfway point marked. The length of the IPD will need to be a minimum of 40cm for inclusion.       The insertion site will need to be 20cm proximal to the superior pole of the patella and at       least 20ml distal to the ASIS. The attending anesthesiologist / acute pain attending either       perform or supervise regional anesthesia fellows to place the CACB no more proximal than the       halfway mark of the IPD. For example, if a patient has an IPD of 50cm, the halfway mark will       be at 25cm and this would be the site of insertion as it would be within the anatomic       adductor canal and would be adequately removed from the surgical site. The skin of the right       or left anterior-medial thigh will be sterilized and draped under sterile conditions. The       sartorius muscle and femoral artery will be identified by an ultrasound at the marked       IPD-halfway-mark. There, local anesthetic will be infiltrated subcutaneously. The needle is       inserted in the direction of the hyperechoic nerve and the hypoechoic femoral artery using       ultrasound assistance. When the needle tip is deep to the sartorius and in proximity of the       artery, 15ml of 0.2% ropivacaine will be injected through the needle with repeat aspiration       every 5 ml. The nerve catheter will be placed 3-5 cm past the needle tip and secured with       steri-strips and bio-occlusive dressing. The CACB rate will be 4ml/hr of bupivacaine       0.0625%.        By design, Observers should only be aware of a singular kind of patient; those with CPNBs.        The dressing of the cACB will be very similar to the CFNB and the standard yellow connector       piece will be secured to the skin with bio-occlusive covering, and the location will be at       level of the anterior superior iliac spine ASIS. This standardized dressing will serve to       aid in blinding the observers as to which kind of continuous block the patient received.       Labeling of the catheter and dressing will not differ. The nerve block billing record will       contain the information on the particular approach used.        Sciatic nerve block placement: the corresponding right or left gluteal area will be       sterilized and draped under sterile conditions, the sciatic nerve will be identified by an       ultrasound in the lower gluteal region where a local anesthetic will be infiltrated       subcutaneously. A trans-gluteal approach will be used to inject normal saline through the       needle to assist catheter placement; the catheter will be introduced for 3-5 cm past the       needle tip and secured with steri strips and tegaderm. No local anesthetic will be       administered until the postoperative period. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  Able to consent to regional anesthesia and having primary total knee              arthroplasty/replacement          Exclusion Criteria:            -  Body-Mass Index >40            -  Iliac to Patella Distance IPD <40cm            -  Pre-existing quadriceps weakness of involved surgical side Chronic opioid use if              using opioids within 4 weeks of surgery: excluded ");

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Anemia is common following delivery. It is associated with disturbing symptoms such as       fatigue, cognitive impairment and syncope in severe cases. International guidelines       recommend to use intravenous iron sucrose to treat intermediate and severe anemia until the       target hemoglobin is achieved. However, patients compliance after delivery is low, making       the administration of several doses difficult. In those cases oral iron supplements might be       used.

Though about a third of delirium cases can benefit from intervention,       detecting and predicting delirium is still very limited in practice. A common       characterization of delirium is changes in activity level, causing patients to become       hyperactive or hypoactive which is manifested in facial expressions and total body       movements. This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility of a delirium detection       system using movement data obtained from 3-axis wearable accelerometers and Microsoft Kinect       sensor, in conjunction with electronics medical record EMR data to analyze the relation of       whole-body movement as well as facial expressions with delirium. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The aim of the study is to assess the potential of motion and facial expression data for       detecting delirium in ICU patients by comparing motion and facial expression patterns in       delirium and control group. In this study, the investigators will use ActivePalTM       accelerometer to record each subjects movement patterns. Also, a processed video using the       KINECT application-programming interface to identify patient facial expressions and movement       patterns. A total of 40 participants will be enrolled with delirium and 20 patients without       delirium will be used as control group. Motion profiles will be compared in the motorically       defined subgroups hyperactive, hypoactive, normal based on accelerometer and Kinect data.       Then differences in facial expression, number of changes in postures and percentage of time       spent moving between motorically defined subgroups and in delirium and control group.

The study will enroll 150 patients in 20 centers in Italy. Patients will be randomized in a       2:1 ratio to receive either BG00012 240 mg BID or placebo for 24weeks.        The primary objective of the study is to assess the early efficacy of treatment with BG00012       240 mg BID in the brain of newly diagnosed and naive-to-treatment patients with RRMS.        Secondarily, the time course of this beneficial effect will be assessed and the safety of       BG00012 will be evaluated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BG00012, a new oral formulation of dimethyl fumarate, has been recently approved by Food and       Drug Administration FDA and European Medicines Agency EMA for the treatment of adult       patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis RRMS.        Its mechanism of action appears to be mediated, at least in part, through activation of the       nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway, a       critical cellular defense mechanism for mitigating oxidative, inflammatory, and xenobiotic       stress.        Inflammation in relapsing MS is indicated by the infiltration of immune cells into the CNS       and consequent damage to the blood-brain barrier that can be visualized on       gadolinium-enhanced MRI.        BG00012 has shown to produce a significant beneficial effect on clinical as well as MRI       efficacy parameters in RRMS in two pivotal Phase III trials, namely DEFINE and CONFIRM. In       particular, BG00012 has shown to significantly reduce the proportion of patients with       relapse, the ARR, disability progression DEFINE and the mean number of Gd+, T2- and       T1-weighted MRI lesions compared to placebo after two years treatment.        Additionally to clinical effects as well as on conventional MRI scans, that are very       sensitive to focal white matter pathology in MS, BG00012 has shown to determine significant       improvements in Magnetization Transfer Ratio MTR in both whole brain and normal appearing       brain tissue NABT at 24 weeks and 2 years compared to baseline in DEFINE study. In DEFINE       study, MTR analysis of Gd+ lesions has also been performed, however, due to the intense       suppression of Gd+ lesion activity of BG00012 treatment, data from only 7 patients in the       active arm compared to 29 in the placebo group were available and differences were not       observed between treatment arms. Changes in MTR of the brain have been shown in animal       models to be sensitive to changes in myelin content; MTR decreases with acute demyelination       and increases with myelination. MTR can be used to detect changes in myelin density in NABT       as well as in focal lesions of patients with MS, thus representing a new valuable tool for       assessing the effects of disease-modifying therapies in MS.        Additionally, results of post-hoc analyses of pooled data from DEFINE and CONFIRM studies       show that BG00012 240 mg BID has a major effect on the subgroup of naïve-to-treatment and       newly diagnosed patients, who were randomized within one year median time from the MS       diagnosis. In this subgroup, the ARR, the number of Gd+, T2- and T1-weighted MRI lesions was       reduced by 56%, 92%, 80% and 68%, respectively, in the BG00012 group compared to placebo.       The mechanism of action of BG00012 and the relevant clinical efficacy on inflammatory       conventional MRI parameters, mainly Gd+ lesions, provide support for a further investigation       of BG00012 in newly diagnosed and naïve-to-treatment RRMS patients. Furthermore, no       information regarding the MRI onset of efficacy of BG00012 treatment in this group of       patients is currently available neither data on improvement of MTR changes in whole brain,       NABT and Gd+ lesions that treatment with BG00012 can provide. Furthermore, no data regarding       the effect of Tecfidera on the accumulation of brain cortical lesions are available.        The primary goal of this study is to assess the MRI short-term onset of efficacy of BG00012       in newly diagnosed and naïve-to-treatment patients with RRMS. For this purpose, a       conventional MRI efficacy primary endpoint will be evaluated.        Exploratory objectives of the study are to assess MTR changes of whole brain, NABT and Gd+       lesions at 24 weeks, mean number of cortical lesionsand brain volume changes in newly       diagnosed and naïve-to-treatment patients after 24 week treatment with BG00012 compared to       placebo. As recently demonstrated, a higher cortical lesion load has been clearly associated       with a higher rate of progression in disability, as measured by the EDSS, and cortical       lesion volume was found to be an independent predictor of future cognitive status.        This is a phase IV, interventional, multicenter, randomized, double blind,       placebo-controlled, 24 week study to assess the MRI onset of efficacy of BG00012 240 mg BID       in newly diagnosed naïve-to-treatmentRRMS patients.        The study will enroll 150 patients in 20 centers in Italy. Patients will be randomized in a       2:1 ratio to receive either BG00012 240 mg BID or placebo for 24 weeks. The study period       will consist of screening,24-week treatment and 4-week follow-up.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Long-bone fractures are a very common complain for visits in paediatric emergency       departments. Since these fractures are often very painful, morphine is considered the       cornerstone treatment in case of severe pain. Very few data are available concerning the       assessment of analgesic treatment in this condition. In our previous study, less than 50% of       patients with a limb fracture had a Visual Analog Scale VAS ≤ 30 mm after morphine       administration. Thus, one study make the hypothesis that the use of a combination of       morphine and/or paracetamol and/or NSAID could be an effective and safe option for the       treatment of pain due to long bone fractures. We undertake to compare different combinations       of paracetamol and ibuprofen with morphine to determine the efficacy and safety of these       strategies in emergency department paediatric patients with acute traumatic limb pain.

The compression regime consists of a two-layered compression stocking applied       after surgery and a massage boot applied both before and after surgery.        The largest part of the study is the clinical trial, with which we aim to prove the       hypothesis:        * That the compression regime reduces wound infections from 10-40% to 5% on patients with a       broken ankle Either one side of the ankle, two or three sides including the posterior part       of the ankle DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Malleolar fractures        Surgical treatment of patients with malleolar fractures imposes a special challenge for       orthopaedic surgeons. A typical ankle fracture results in haematoma, sometimes blistering       and almost always oedema formation. This postpones the optimal time for surgery. When       operating on a swollen ankle, it becomes obvious for the surgeon that the tissue elasticity       and normal structure is changed. This can complicate the surgical approach, procedure, the       reduction of the fracture and the closure of the incision. Quite often the skin is difficult       to adapt, resulting in excessive tension on the sutures. This can potentially lead to skin       necrosis and wound dehiscence. Blood and fluid imbibed tissue and prolonged operating time,       increases the risk of post-operative infection, and thereby give the patient painful and       extended post-operative course.        When striving to give the patient a good treatment and rehabilitation, it is paramount to       prevent surgical complications.        Compression therapy, as part of the standard treatment of ankle fractures, is not yet       described in the literature and no previous study has tested its efficiency in this patient       group, in a systematic manner. It is a new, innovative way of helping the patients to faster       rehabilitation and to prevent surgical soft tissue complications.        If this study proves the expected effect on soft tissue complications, compression therapy       will probably also show an effect on other fracture types: knee-, wrist-, tibia- and femoral       fractures, making compression therapy an integrated part of the standard fracture regime in       all orthopaedic departments.        Malleolar fractures in Denmark has an incidence of 107/100.000 person, making it one of the       most common fracture types in the country. In Denmark 6000 malleolar fractures are operated       each year.        Studies have shown increased complication rates in the elderly, diabetics, smokers, patients       on immunomodulating medication, alcoholics, and patients with osteoporosis and peripheral       neuropathy.        Treatment of malleolar fractures in Denmark shows great local variations, and standard       differs between hospitals, often with a low grade of clinical evidence.        Nordsjællands Hospital has decided, to implement a standard regime of Flowtron Hydroven 3™       and Coban™ 2 lite, to prevent oedema formation and blistering. The decision came after       clinicians having observed a high incidence of oedema, blistering and wound healing problems       in this cohort of patients, often forcing surgeons to postpone surgery and prolonging       inpatient stay, resulting in a long and cumbersome rehabilitation for the patient.        Intermittent pneumatic compression        Intermittent pneumatic compression IPC is used mainly in prevention of DVT. The use of IPC       in treatment of postoperative soft tissue care is only sporadically mentioned in the       literature. These studies define the mechanisms of action as either mechanical or chemical.       The mechanical effect is due to improved vascularity, redirection of blood flow and cyclic       loading. The chemical effect is caused by increased production of nitric oxide NO,       producing vasodilation and the increase of inflammatory mediators, promoting heeling by       stimulating proliferation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Some studies have       investigated the effect of IPC on the vascularity of bone and soft tissue animal studies,       fracture related oedema and oedema related to venous disease and other medical conditions,       showing a convincing effect on all. Accumulating data from experimental animal studies       suggest that the use of IPC increases neurovascular ingrowth, the amount of newly organized       parallel collagen fibres, fibroblast proliferation and proliferative repair. Further IPC       counteract the negative influence immobilization has on tissue repair. Therefore,       theoretically one should expect that application of an IPC unit on a newly operated and       immobilized patients ankle, would prevent oedema formation, speed up tissue regeneration and       enhance arterial blood flow thereby preventing wound healing problems defined as infection,       wound dehiscence, prolonged healing, skin necrosis, exposed hardware, and maybe also       accelerate bone heeling.        COBAN 2 lite        Coban™ 2 lite is a compression bandage consisting of an inner comfort layer and an outer       stretch layer, designed to deliver therapeutic compression for the treatment of venous leg       ulcers and related conditions. The bandage is purposed for patients less tolerant of       compression, with mixed aetiology and a ABPI ankle brachial pressure index ≥ 0,5.       Correctly applied, the bandage take the form of a solid tube which reduces slippage and let       the patient wear it for up to several weeks without the need of re-application. The use of       compression stockings and bandages are well described in literature, and an integrated part       of the management of oedema end venous ulcers, but not addressed when it comes to fracture       treatment.        Adverse effects        Intermittent pneumatic compression The IPC device is routinely employed in prevention of       deep venous thromboembolism DVT and subsequently pulmonary embolism PE and in the       management of lymfoedema. It is considered a safe and efficient alternative to medical       thromboprophylaxis and only few adverse effects have been described in literature, all       consisting of case reports.        When using IPC as DVT prophylaxis it is often applied during surgery and with the patient in       general anaesthesia, hindering the patient in reporting any discomfort. One author describes       a case, where application of IPC on a patient with cancer associated thrombosis and       embolism, results in a pulmonary embolism. The patient did not show signs of having a DVT       prior to surgery, and the author concludes that the PE might have taken place regardless of       the application of IPC devices.        Two case reports describes peroneal nerve palsy as a possible adverse effect to IPC. The       first case concerns a woman with pancreatic cancer and weight loss, who develops peroneal       nerve palsy bilaterally under surgery, probably because there is no subcutaneous fat to       protect the nerve against the applied pressure between the fibular head and the compression       boot. The second case concerns an obese patient undergoing 10 hours intracranial surgery.        One author reports a case where an older woman with postoperative delirium and fragile skin       develops hemorrhagic bullae under the IPC-device. This could probably have been avoided, had       the patient not ben delirious an inept of reporting discomfort.        Some authors have tried to associate the IPS unit to compartment syndrome, but the cases       have all been on patients whom have undergone prolonged operation in the lithotomy state,       which is known to increase the risk for compartment syndrome in the lower leg.        Malfunctioning of the equipment is described in literature, but is rare. The IPC-device can       cause warmth and sweating under the inflatable textile and discomfort if it is placed       incorrectly or directly on top of a suture.        Compression bandage        There are no descriptions in literature of major side effects to the compression bandage.       During the early implementation of compression treatment of malleolar fracture at the unit       of Orthopaedic Surgery, Nordsjællands Hospital, pressure-wounds have been observed, and in       one case with a visible Achilles tendon. Several minor pressure wounds have been noted, but       these have all successfully healed under conservative treatment.        The Coban™ 2 lite can cause discomfort such as tightness, if applied to firmly. The inner       comfortlayer can chafe bony prominences or tendons if applied to thick.        Precautionary measures        In order to prevent any side effects or discomfort, the project manager routinely and       frequently examines all patients included in the trial. This will take place both in the       Emergency Department, at the bedward 48-72 hours after admission, and postoperatively.        The staff will receive ongoing training in the application and observation of both Coban™ 2       lite and the Flowtron Hydroven 3™, in order to prevent any malfunctioning or misapplication.        Hypotheses and Aims        Hypotheses        Study1 - That the compression regime reduces wound infections from 10-40% to 5% on patients       with mono-, bi-, and trimalleolar fractures treated according to the ORIF-principles open       reduction internal fixation        Study 2        - That the retrospective study will establish the historical incidence of infections, before       the compression regime was implemented.

Procordo        Randomization, stratification, visualization of data, and data storage will be managed using       an IT system called Procordo Procordo ApS Rugaardsvej 5 DK-8680 Ry Denmark.        Study procedures        Study design:        Sub study 1: Patients are included in the Emergency Department red by the doctor on duty       or the project manager, if they are willing to participate and have given consent after       written and oral information about the study. As part of the standard treatment, X-rays are       taken to confirm the diagnosis. The fracture will be evaluated for the need of surgery,       according to the department standard:          1. Unstable fractures SU3+4, SA2, PA2+3, PU2+3+4. Particularly SU-fractures are            important to examine closely, in order to rule out ligamentous damage on the medial            malleolar.          2. Dislocated fractures in the lateral malleolus, with maximum diastases of 2 mm.          3. Fracture of the medial malleolus.        Standard blood tests will be carried out, if deemed necessary, and the affected ankle will       be treated with a splint, according to the Emergency Departments standard procedures. The       patient will hereafter get randomized. Randomization, stratification, visualization of data,       and data storage will be managed using an IT system called Procordo Procordo ApS       Rugaardsvej 5 DK-8680 Ry Denmark. Patients will be block randomized into blocks of 6-10.       This size is chosen because of the stratification according to two variables, to make sure       that an equal distribution of stratae is obtained each block. Block size is blinded for the       researcher. The system will use a sequence of 300, and patients will be stratified according       to diabetes, smoking and need for closed reduction. The patient will be on-line randomized       in the emergency department, as close to the actual treatment as possible, in order to       prevent superfluous drop-out. Randomization is handled by either a doctor or a nurse using a       computer interface designed by Procordo. The person to include will open the computer, use       the shortcut symbol to the randomization interface, type the user name and code accessible       to the personnel in the emergency department. A sign with username and code will be hanging       next to the computer. The user will be asked to identify him/herself by name, and to type       several patient specific parameters: sex, CPR-number, fracture type, diabetes, smoking and       others. The computer will search in the 300-sequence and come up with the next available       number either 1 or 2 to allocate the patient. The sequence is designed according to       block-size, p-value 0,5 or 0,5 and the total number of 300. The allocation process itself       is hidden from the investigator, and at no point in the process, will the system reveal if       the patient is in the treatment- or the control-arm. This makes it possible to blind the       treatment later on, when the patient visit the out-patient clinic. In theory the       randomization interface is accessible to all personnel in the emergency department, which is       why every inclusion will be checked by the project manager.        To avert confounding treatments, a sign will be put on the patient bed during       hospitalization, communicating which group the patient belongs to.        The project manager will control that the intervention/non-intervention is applied according       to the study protocol. This is done by continuous visits to the bed ward, examining the       patients to see if the Coban2 lite™, Flowtron Hydroven™ and Braun frame are correctly used.        The Intervention group pink: Will receive compression therapy in the form of a Flowtron       Hydroven™, 40-60 mmHg, ¾-1 hour, 3 times a day, when diagnosed and allocated in the       emergency department, either on top of the splint, or if no splint is administered, on top       of the dressing. This treatment will be continued, until the patient is fit for surgery       according to clinical priority and theatre availability. The surgical procedure will follow       the standards of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.        After finished surgery, the doctor or nurse in the operating room OR will apply a dry,       non-adherent, wound dressing Vliwasorb® Lohmann & Rauscher, Gøngehusvej 252, DK-2950       Vedbæk, Denmark and Coban2 lite™. The patient will continue the Flowtron Hydroven™       treatment in the bed ward 40-60 mmHg, ¾-1 hour 3 times a day on top of the Coban2 lite™       bandage, until discharge.        Before discharge the patient is fitted with a Walker boot, unless there is bad compliance or       no pulse in arteria dorsalis pedis or tibialis anterior, in which case a CobraCast walking       bandage is applied. Both boot and bandage is applied at the bed ward, when the patient has       recovered from anaesthesia/analgesia, and worn during fysiotherapy and mobilization.       Observation and control of both Flowtron Hydroven™ and Coban2 lite™ in the ward are carried       out by the nurses with special training, according to standard procedures, and by the       project manager who will collect data between 48-72 hours after admission. On the day of       discharge, the Coban2 lite™ is removed, the wound dressing changed and a new Coban2 lite™ is       re-applied. According to standard treatment, x-rays are taken after 2 and 6 weeks, and the       patient is seen in the outpatient clinic accordingly. At both visits, clinical photos will       be taken of the surgical wound, in order to blind the clinical evaluation. Two senior       doctors will later be asked to evaluate the photos and determine if infection or wound       dehiscence is present. At the 2 weeks visit the Coban2 lite™ and stitches are removed, and a       compression stocking is fitted. The project manager will note any wound healing problems       infection, wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, visible osteosynthesis material.        The Walker boot or CobraCast walking splint is re-applied. At the 6 weeks visit, x-rays will       be taken, and again the project manager will note any wound healing problems infection,       wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, visible osteosynthesis material. If all parameters are       acceptable, the patient course, and follow up is concluded.        The control group: In the Emergency Department the affected leg will be elevated on a Braun       Frame, and this treatment will continue in the bed ward, until the patient is fit for       surgery according to clinical priority and theatre availability.        The surgical procedure will follow the standards of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.        After surgery, a Vliwasorb® wound dressing and TubiGrip™ bandage Mölnlycke Health Care ApS,       Gydevang 33, DK-3450 Allerød, Denmark is applied. Finally the ankle is stabilized in a       Walker boot, unless there is bad compliance or no pulse in arteria dorsalis pedis or       tibialis anterior, in which case a CobraCast walking bandage is applied. Both boot and       bandage is applied at the bed ward, when the patient has recovered from       anaesthesia/analgesia, and worn during fysiotherapy and mobilization. According to standard       treatment, x-rays are taken after 2 and 6 weeks, and the patient is seen in the outpatient       clinic accordingly. At both visits, clinical photos will be taken of the surgical wound, in       order to blind the clinical evaluation. Two senior doctors will be asked to evaluate the       photos and determine if infection or wound dehiscence is present. At the 2 weeks visit, the       TubiGrip™ and stitches are removed. The project manager will note any wound healing problems       infection, wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, visible osteosynthesis material, and the       TubiGrip™ and Walker boot are re-applied. At the 6 weeks visit, X-rays will be taken, and       again the project manager will note any wound healing problems infection, wound dehiscence,       skin necrosis, visible osteosynthesis material. If all parameters are acceptable, the       patient course, and follow up is concluded.        Sub study 2: All treatments in this study have been closed, at the time of data collection.       So the project will have no influence on the course of the patients.        Material:        Sub study 1: Each year approximately 170 malleolar fractures are operated on at       Nordsjællands Hospital. Of these 78 are realistically to be included into the project, and       studied according to the study variables outlined below. The inclusion period runs for 24       months or till 2x78 = 156 patients are included, and start 1/10/2013.        Sub study 2: The 1/10/2013 the retrospective cohort study begins. 78 patient files will be       studied according to the study variables outlined below. The patient files must be dated       from before the department of orthopaedic surgery implemented the use of compression therapy       as a routine treatment for ankle fractures.        5 Study variables Applies to both, the intervention and control group.

Ethical considerations        The National Committee on Health Research Ethics:        An application has been forwarded to the Regional Committee on Health Research Ethics, dated       7/12/2012. Application number: 36522        The Danish Data Protection Agency: journal no. 2012-41-1331. Exempted from reporting on the       5th December 2012, as private medical research projects, which must be reported to the       National Committee on Health Research Ethics, are no longer required to report to the Danish       Data Protection Agency. The project manager is registered as private responsible for the       data Danish: privat dataansvarlig and undertakes to ensure that the applicable personal       data laws for medical research projects are followed by the research group.        Danish Health and Medicines Authority, Pharmacovigilance and Medical Devices Case no.       2012113737. The study is assessed not to require notification according to the regulations       for medical equipment § 9, part 1 and therefore does not require reporting to the National       Board of Health or the Danish Health and Medicines Authority, Pharmacovigilance and Medical       Devices.        Informed consent:        A decision to participate in the research project will be obtained from all patients       participating in the study. The decision is made upon due information on the nature,       significance, implications and risks of the project and upon receipt of suitable written       documentation. It is made voluntarily by a person who is capable of giving his or her       consent. The consent shall be in writing, dated and signed, and is obtained in the Emergency       Department ED The patient will be recruited in the ED as soon as the inclusion diagnosis       is made. The initial contact and inclusion will be handled by the doctor on duty or the       project manager. He or she will provide the above-mentioned written and oral information.       The patients in the ED are examined in small booths, separated by curtains. This provides       the necessary privacy to perform a physical examination, but preventing other patients from       overhearing conversation can be difficult. Therefor the patient should be offered the       possibility to continue the conversation in a quiet interview room. The patient is offered       to have an assessor participate in the conversation. All patients must be offered due       reconsideration time before making up their minds, this means enough time to talk to the       assessor or make a phone call. For practical reasons though, it will be difficult to offer       more than 60 minutes reconsideration time, due to the urgent nature of the trauma and the       urgent need for surgery. Furthermore the Flowtron Hydroven™ need to be applied relatively       quickly after the patient has been diagnosed with the ankle fracture, in order to obtain the       best effect. The nature of the intervention is considered non-invasive and with few adverse       effect, justifying the relatively short reconsideration time. The Informed consent form must       be signed before the patient leaves the ED and the patient can at any time decide to       withdraw from the project, without consequence to further treatment.        Good Clinical Practice The local GCP-committee GCP region Hovedstaden has been contacted       and report that the study is exempted from reporting to the GCP.

Epigenetics is a novel field of biology studying       the mechanisms by which the environment interacts with the genotype to produce a variety of       phenotypes through modifications to chromatin that do not directly alter the DNA sequence. A       very limited number of epigenetic studies have been published in patients with HT and GD so       far. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze DNA methylation status in White       Blood Cells WBCs within the promoter regions of genomic sites that have been previously       identified as susceptibility loci or sites for autoimmune thyroid disease, such as the CD40,       FOXP3, CTLA4, PTPN22, CD25, and TPO genes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Hashimoto Thyroiditis HT and Graves Disease GD are known to be caused by abnormal immune       response against self cells and tissues. HT involves a cell-mediated autoimmune destruction       of the thyroid leading to hypothyroidism. GD is caused by a process in which immune cells       make stimulating antibodies against the thyroid stimulating hormone TSH receptor on the       thyroid gland, thus leading to hyperthyroidism. Although there is substantial evidence that       genetic factors increase the risk for developing autoimmune diseases, monozygotic twins       still remain discordant for disease disease concordance is never 100%, thus suggesting a       role for environmental factors and epigenetics.        Epigenetics is a novel field of biology studying the mechanisms by which the environment       interacts with the genotype to produce a variety of phenotypes through modifications to       chromatin that do not directly alter the DNA sequence. These modifications have been       associated with altered gene expression and silencing of repetitive elements and can be       inherited mitotically. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modifications,       or miRNA post-transcriptional regulation. DNA methylation involves the covalent addition of       a methyl group to the carbon-5 position in the CpG dinucleotide from the methyl donor       S-adenosylmethionine and is mediated by a group of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases       DNMTs. CpG dinucleotides are typically grouped together in regions known as CGIs       islands. CGIs can be found in the promoter regions of genes, and CpG methylation of these       gene promoters is associated with transcriptional silencing. In contrast, hypermethylated       genes have been found to be transcriptionally active.        A very limited number of epigenetic studies have been published in patients with HT and GD       so far. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze DNA methylation status in White       Blood Cells WBCs within the promoter regions of genomic sites that have been previously       identified as susceptibility loci or sites for autoimmune thyroid disease, such as the CD40,       FOXP3, CTLA4, PTPN22, CD25, and TPO genes.        Initially, recruitment of patients and controls as well as blood sample collection will be       done. A complete physical examination will also be performed in all participants included in       the study, and a detailed personal, family, gestational and perinatal history will be       obtained as well before inclusion. Blood samples by all participants will be collected and       centrifuged and then White Blood Cells WBCs, plasma and serum will be separated and stored       in a deep freezer.        Laboratory analyses will follow. DNA will be isolated from peripheral leukocytes using the       standard phenol chloroform technique. It will then be treated with sodium bisulfite using       the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit, according to the manufacturers protocol. Therefore,       unmethylated cytosines will be converted into uracyls, whereas methylated cytosines will       remain unchanged. Afterwards, a PCR reaction will be performed, targeting specific sequences       in the promoter region of specific gene promoters using specific primers. Amplicons will       then be analyzed by electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet trans-illumination, and       PCR products will be purified using Millipore Centrifugal Filters for DNA purification. A       sequence analysis will also be performed in order to quantitatively describe the methylation       status at the genetic loci under study.        Finally, online bioinformatics resources will be employed for aligning the obtained       sequences e.g., BLAST - http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi and subsequently       identifying their methylated and unmethylated CpGs sites. In case more flexibility and       automation is needed, bioinformatics scripts will be developed from scratch to accomplish       the aforementioned tasks based on powerful, open-source bioinformatics software libraries       e.g., Biopython - http://biopython.org/. An electronic Data Base will be constructed and       Statistical Analysis will follow. Results and Conclusions will be published in peer-review       journals and presented in International Meetings.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02505061","TITLE:       The Use of Modified ride-on Cars to Advance Mobility and Socialization in Young Children With Disabilities SUMMARY:       The four purposes of this study are: 1 to examine the feasibility of providing children       with disabilities to explore the environment with a modified ride-on car; 2 to quantify       whether children with disabilities are able to have more social interactions with a ride-on       car; 3 to examine the progression of socialization during the intervention and follow-up       phases to determine which factors might influence the learning curve; 4 to compare the       effectiveness of using the modified toy cars through the hospital-based program and regular       therapy program after intervention and follow-up phases to determine the critical factors on       increasing independent mobility and socialization, including motivation, treatment executor,       treatment environment and play programs. It can provide guidelines for the future       intervention.        Independent mobility is believed to be essential for perceptual-motor, cognition, language       and social skill development. It is important to increase the independent mobility in       children with disabilities and further enhance their development, especially motor and       socialization. Assistive and power mobility devices allow children with disabilities to move       independently within their environment and may increase the opportunities to explore and       interact with people and environment . However, issues to consider before prescribing an       assistive device include factors such as age, accessibly to community environments, cost,       social acceptance of the device and the adaptability of the device to growth. This study is       to use the customized, modified ride-on toy cars, to enhance the independent mobility,       exploration and socialization through low-cost, family-centered approach. It will also       improve familys understanding of childrens capabilities, which improve their development.       Investigators will recruit 60 children with who are between 1 to 3 years old and diagnosed       as motor delay >1.5 sd. They will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups:       hospital-based program group and regular therapy group.        The whole study duration will be 18 weeks, including 9-week intervention and 9-week       follow-up; the total amount of treatment will be equal for two groups. The hospital-based       program will be administered by the therapist and include 120 minutes/per session, 2       sessions/per week. In addition, the research team will visit the hospital once/per week to       provide assessments. The regular therapy group will continue their regular therapy without       any additional car driving training. The research team will visit them once/per week for the       assessments. The assessments include behavior coding from the videotapes and the clinical       assessments. The findings of this study will help to understand the feasibility and       effectiveness of using the low-tech modified toy cars on advancing childrens mobility and       socialization. They can be used in the clinics and are a low cost alternative or addition to       other mobility devices. They may provide a novel therapeutic tool to improve mobility,       socialization and development. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Children with mobility disabilities have more limited opportunities to explore their       environment; therefore, they are considered to be at risk of secondary impairments, such as       cognitive, spatial-perceptual, and social-emotional delay. Independent mobility is believed       to be essential for perceptual-motor and social skills development. Self-produced locomotion       is an organizer of psychological changes in typically developing infants/children,       especially developmental changes in perceptions, social understanding, spatial cognitive,       and emotions. Power mobility devices provide the potential for children with disabilities to       move more independently and increase their exploration and interaction with the social and       physical environment. Through the exploration, infants can detect the object and       individual‟s information that relates size, orientation, shape, substance to their       perceptual and movement capabilities and interpersonal relationships. Logically, starting       powered mobility as part of a comprehensive Early Intervention EI program within the first       year of life should not only provide mobility but also reduce secondary impairments for       children with disabilities. Although of increasing interest, there is very little empirical       evidence of the effects or even feasibility of early power mobility training on development,       particularly for mobility and socialization. A hallmark of daily life for the typically       developing infants and toddlers is hours of mobility nested within exploration,       socialization and object play in the home and community.Pediatric rehabilitation, through       training and assistive technology AT, seeks to provide children with disabilities with       this same level of mobility, exploration and socialization. There are many basic barriers to       achieving this high standard and no single AT or combination of AT can currently provide the       level of mobility that children, families and therapists desire. For example, certain       characteristics of the most common commercial pediatric power wheelchairs limit their use in       the home and community spaces such as playgrounds. These limitations include price e.g.,       typically $5000, size and weight e.g., typically >150 lbs, transportation requirements       e.g., van or truck, maintenance and aesthetics and social acceptance. The most obvious       limitation for including power mobility in EI programs is the complete lack of readily       available power chairs for children younger than 2-3 years of age, the period when mobility       is rapidly developing for typically developing children. Experimental power mobility devices       have the potential to address some of these limitations such as size, weight and infant use.       Unfortunately these are likely years from commercial availability. Furthermore, power       wheelchairs have historically been designed to address a limited set of goals related to       mobility with minimal consideration of socialization. Investigators believe there is a need       for readily available mobility options for immediate use by very young children and their       families that address some of the above limitations while expanding the role of power       devices past simply mobility and into socialization. The general purpose of this study is to       determine the feasibility of using a ride-on toy car as an early option for power       mobility. Furthermore, this study will examine the effects of using a toy car to advance       mobility and socialization in the early development. The use of modified ride-on toy cars       may provide a readily available, convenient and fun way for families, therapists and early       educators to help young children improve their mobility starting within the first years of       life. There are four strengths of using ride-on toy cars for mobility. First, the cost is       comparable or less than most mobility devices. Second, most are relatively lightweight,       small and easily transported in contrast to power chairs. Third, the child-friendly,       colorful toy designs are more acceptable to adults and children and likely seen as simply a       toy. This may be an important aspect for clinicians wanting to start early power mobility       training with families hesitant to discuss powered chair options. Fourth, because toy cars       are simple electromachanical devices, they can be modified quickly and easily to match the       childs current and/or future abilities and goals. Ride-on cars provide fun and mobility for       typically developing children and have serious potential to be a power mobility option for       children with disabilities. Investigators have recently published a technical report outing       the basic components and exemplar modifications. Our pilot study has also shown positive       effects on increased socialization in a 2-year old child with severe cerebral palsy. No       studies have been published on the effectiveness or even the feasibility of including these       cars with any pediatric population. Thus basic questions such as sitting tolerance, basic       driving ability and interest in using the car for socialization have not been addressed       prior to wide spread clinical use. The long term effects of using this mobility device on       mobility and socialization also remain a question for the researchers and clinicians. In       addition, little is known about the learning curve of using the power mobility device to       improve mobility and socialization, e.g., at what point in time maximal effects are       reached. Up to now, most of the studies have focused on the end results of increased amount       of independent mobility in daily life. It is still unknown whether optimal maximal effects       are being reached at all and which factors e.g., training environment, training executor       might influence the learning curve as well as the retention of treatment effects in the long       term. In the study by Tieman et al. 2004, they suggested that therapists should examine       childrens performances in the settings that are important to their daily life. Examining       performance in everyday settings enables the therapists not only to observe the childs       ability, but also to assess environmental features that either facilitate or hinder       mobility. Our study will focus on providing intervention and exploratory assessments in the       home or a clinical setting. This information is essential for making future decisions on       whether interventions should focus on the child‟s motor ability in a therapeutic environment       from the therapists perspective, or adaptation of the natural environment for the       caregivers application. In this study, investigators will modify ride-on toy cars for       children with disabilities for use in the clinical settings as part of a 18-week power       mobility training program. Investigators focus on four basic questions. Specifically, can       investigators: 1 select and modify toy cars such that children with motor impairments enjoy       sitting and driving, 2 select a set of dependent measures that quantify whether the       children increase their independent mobility and socialization; 3 determine the factors       that influence the learning curve of independent mobility and socialization during       intervention and follow-up phases; 4 conduct a hospital-based training program that results       in a high level of fun for the child and compliance by the family and therapists. If our       results are generally positive and show significant differences between different programs,       then future randomized controlled trial studies could further quantify the effectiveness and       the feasibility with different treatment intensity and various pediatric populations.        Evidence supported that independent mobility might improve different skills for children       with mobility impairments, including spatial awareness skills, eye-hand coordination, visual       perceptual skills, spontaneous vocalizations, initiation of contact with others,motivation       to explore and an increased ability to interact meaningfully with peers. Although the       mobility devices are considered to be used to compensate for disabilities causing       difficulties with the accomplishment of daily activities and social roles, the current       standard of clinical practice in the United States for power wheelchair training is that       children must demonstrate certain prerequisite abilities before they are eligible. As a       result, power mobility training, based on readiness, if offered clinically to children       between 2 and 6 years old, with 3 years being the average age of the youngest child being       recommended for a power wheelchair.However, several studies have demonstrated that early       power mobility training is feasible, even for the children who may be categorized as in a       not-ready group based on their age, motor or cognitive abilities. These children had       various types of disabilities which limited their self produced locomotion. Most of them       were younger than 3 years of age and the youngest one was only 7-month-old. The early power       mobility training allowed these young children with mobility impairments move independently       and have positive impacts on overall development. The investigators reported increased       vocalizations, increased arm and hand movements, greater motivation to explore,increased       self-confidence and curiosity and positive effects on family life in these children. Power       mobility devices can not only be designed to compensate childrens impairments for       independent mobility, but also be used as a novel, training device to address socialization,       body functions, activity and participation goals. Combined with a family centered e.g.,       coaching of parents, functional approach which aims to promote better functioning in the       context of daily life settings e.g., home environment, early power mobility training can       help to enhance development and improve social participation in childrens daily life.       Current power wheelchairs have limitations that limit their functional use in the community.       These include their size, weight, cost, accessibility, ease of transportation, maintenance       requirements, adaptability to the body growth and social acceptance. Experimental devices       have the potential to address some limitations such as size, weight and cost but may be       years from commercial availability. Providing a new option of device for early power       mobility which addresses these environmental limitations is necessary. Furthermore, this       device can also be used to focus on the three ICF levels as a training tool. For example,       our technique report of modifying ride-on toy cars as power mobility devices introduces an       alternative way to provide early power mobility training. Compared to traditional pediatric       power wheelchairs, the strengths of modified toy cars include less cost, more accessibility       to community environments, better aesthetic and adjustability. Moreover, a modified toy car       is unlike a powered wheelchairs which is a medical device and typically focuses on activity       and participation levels of ICF. Various permanent and temporary modifications of a toy car       allow clinicians to address one or more ICF levels. For example, more trunk support may help       a child to reach the steering wheel and grasp toys during car movement to address an ICF       activity goal. By lessening the trunk support modifications in combination with a simple       steering system e.g., a push-button switch, clinicians can provide the child with a more       challenging, dynamic postural control during driving to address an ICF body functions and       structure goal. The child-friendly frame of the toy car can motivate a childs exploratory       behaviors and may have positive impacts on familys and/or other peoples perceptions of a       childs capabilities. These strengths of a ride on toy car make it become the appropriate       candidate for the family and therapists to improve early independent mobility and       socialization for children with mobility disabilities.        The specific aims of this study are: 1 to examine the feasibility of providing children       with disabilities to explore the environment with a modified ride-on car; 2 to quantify       whether children with disabilities are able to have more social interactions with a ride-on       car; 3 to examine the progression of socialization to determine which factors might       influence the learning curve during intervention and follow-up phases; 4 to compare the       effectiveness of using the modified toy cars through the hospital-based program and regular       therapy program to determine the critical factors on increasing independent mobility and       socialization after intervention and follow-up phases, including motivation, treatment       executor, treatment environment and play programs. Through the comparison of Car Play i.e.,       play with the use of toy cars and Natural Play i.e., play without the use of toy cars,       investigators hypothesize that children with disabilities are able to learn how to drive the       modified toy cars in the hospital-based group. They will have increased socialization       i.e.,self-initiated contacts, vocalizations, positive facial expressions when driving the       cars than the regular therapy program, i.e., control group.        Study Design: A pretest-posttest control group design was applied. Two groups were involved       in this project: hospital based program, and regular therapy program. The participants were       randomly assigned to one of the two groups by using the well-sealed, opaque envelopes when       they are recruited in the study. Once the participants were recruited in the study, the       research team modified a toy car based on each participants capabilities during this       pre-intervention phase the first two or three weeks before intervention starts, e.g., seat       and steering wheel modifications. The study duration for each participant was 18 weeks,       including 9-week intervention and 9-week follow-up.        Participantsin the study were 60 infants or preschool children ages 12 months to 36 months       with motor delays sd > 1.5. The age group of infants/preschool children was selected based       on the previous studies on early power mobility training in infants and preschool children.       Power mobility training was typically offered to children between two and six years of age,       with three years being the average age of the youngest child being recommended for a powered       chair. However, studies showed that early power mobility training was feasible for       7-month-old infants and 18-month-old children with mobility disabilities.        Recruitment: The children were recruited from self-referrals, health care practitioners, or       the hospitals in Taipei and Taoyuan, Taiwan where children with motor delays >1.5 sd were       receiving outpatient rehabilitation. The research team initially posted flyers describing       the study at clinical settings and contacted the therapists in the clinical settings to       introduce the goals,criteria and general procedure of the study. Parents/guardians obtained       information about the study through the flyers and their therapists. Parents/guardians, who       were interested and whose children met the criteria of diagnosis, age, capability determined       by the doctor and their therapists, were given contact information for the investigator.       After receiving contact information, the research team contacted the parents/guardian and/or       therapists for scheduling a date of further testing by the research team at the hospital.       When the research team contacted the parents, study was explained and parents received a       letter detailing the procedure and given an opportunity to ask questions. Parents/guardians       signed this informed consent form at the time of the first visit.        Procedure: Before the pre-intervention assessments, the research team modified the cars       seat and acceleration to the hand switch-driven, which allowed the car to be drivable for       the child who met the inclusion criteria. Each child had a customized ride-on toy car in a       hospital. After modifications, they received pre-intervention assessments, including       behavioral videotaping and developmental assessments. The developmental assessments occurred       at the first and last week of the 9-week intervention, and the end of the 9-week follow-up       phase. A therapist who did not involve in the intervention and was blinded to the study       purpose completed all the developmental tests. The driving and socialization behaviors were       videotaped by the research team for 20 minutes/per session, one session/per week before,       during and after the intervention phase at the child house or a hospital. All videotapes       were coded by two independent coders, who were undergraduate students. Prior to making their       ratings, the coder was instructed as to coding procedures by the PI, but he/she was not       informed about the group assignment and the purpose of the study. Cohens kappa coefficient       was calculated between the two independent raters to establish good reliability before       formal coding.        Intervention: Parents/caregivers and occupational therapists were responsible for the       hospital-based rehabilitation service. For the hospital-based program, the research team       discussed with the clinical therapists who provided training program in a hospital for 120       minutes/per session, 2 sessions/per week for a total of 9-week intervention. In addition,       the research team videotaped the childs natural play and driving performance at the       hospital for 20 minutes/per session, 1 session/per week during the 9-week intervention       phase. The treatment program of the two sessions was pre-planned and adjusted by the       occupational therapist through clinical observation of participants performance in the       previous session. Training concentrated on building the concept of casual-effect on the       switch and car motion, goal-oriented driving e.g., driving 200 meters and reach for a toy       or contact with a person, and upper limb use in functional tasks with driving in a       hospital,discussed by the family, the treating therapist and the research team.        Regular Therapy Program: The regular therapy group continued the regular therapy, including       physical, occupational and speech therapy. The general propose of the training was to       improve the developmental scales, mobility, socialization and upper limb use in functional       tasks. The research team videotaped the childs natural play and driving performance at the       hospital for 20 minutes/per session, 1 session/per week during the 9-week intervention       phase.        Follow-up: This period focused on the 9 weeks follow-up after receiving a treatment program.       No treatment program was delivered to the participants. The research team still videotaped       the childs natural play and driving performance at the hospital for 20 minutes/per session,       1 session/per week during the 9-week follow-up phase.        Instrument and Procedure: Each participant received pre-intervention assessments, including       behavioral videotaping and developmental assessments. Behavioral coding involved the       mobility/driving performance during the 10-minute Car Play and socialization during the       whole 20-minute Play i.e., 10-minute Natural Play and 10-minute Car Play. The       developmental assessments occurred at the first and last week of 9-week intervention, and       the end of the 9-week follow-up phase, including the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability       Inventory PEDI, the Bayley Scales of Development, and Parenting Stress Index PSI.       Necessary materials include two video cameras, a parent log and a customized ride-on car.        Data Reduction and Analysis: All videotapes will be coded by two independent coders, who are       undergraduate students. Prior to making their ratings, the coder is instructed as to coding       procedures, but he/she is not informed about the group assignment and the purpose of the       study.        Mobility Measures: The following measures were obtained via video coding the 10-minute Car       Play during pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention phases to determine the       feasibility of learning to drive the car:          1. Driving Categories time in seconds             a. Independent Mobility: When the child independently drives the car preceded by an            independent switch contact without an adults assistance. b. Assisted Mobility: When an            adult puts the child‟s hand on the switch but he independently pushes the switch to            begin driving. c. Caregiver Mobility: When the child drove with an adult‟s hand            directly on top of his hand.          2. Visual Attention to Switch: The frequency number of times that the child looked at            the switch during the 10-minute driving.          3. Stopping Categories number of times divided by total times goal was presented a.            Independent Stop: When the child independently moves his hand off the switch and makes            the car stop within one car length of the goal location. b. Stops with Verbal Cues:            When the child moves his hand off the switch as the car arrives the goal only after            verbal cues given from an adult. c. Stops with Tactile Contacts: When the child moves            his hand off the switch as the car arrives the goal only after tactile cues e.g.,            touching his hand or moving his hand off the switch given from an adult        Socialization Measures: To examine the impact of independent mobility on the socialization       during the 10- minute Natural Play and 10-minute Car Play, the following measures will be       obtained via coding video footage during pre-intervention, intervention and       post-intervention:          1. Reaching for toy/person: The frequency number of times that the child initially            extends arms to the play toy/interacting person.          2. Initiation of contact with others: peer-directed or adult-directed: Target            child-initiated contacts with others are counted whenever two conditions are met: a            the target child initiates the contact with another individual without any observable            prompting or initiating behavior on the part of another person and b the target child            independently vocalizes with either comprehensible words or other vocalizations,            including shouting,laughing, grunting, etc. or physically points to, touches, or            indicates that he or she wants something from another individual. Target            child-initiated contacts and vocalizations are divided into two categories: i            peer-directed and ii adult-directed.          3. Other initiated contacts: contact by peers or by adults: Peer-initiated contacts are            defined as any child initiating any type of contact with the target child e.g.,            talking to the child, touching the child or a mobility device the child is using,            giving a toy or item to the child,taking a toy or item away from the child.            Adult-initiated contacts with the target child are: a carrying, moving, or otherwise            touching the child or the device in which the child is seated e.g., swing, wheelchair,            toy car; b taking a toy or item away from the child          4. Facial Expression: The frequency number of times of both positive and negative facial            expressions appeared during interaction. Positive was determined to include smiling and            laughing. Negative was determined to include discomfort, crying and unhappy facial            expression.          5. Vocalization/Gesture: The frequency number of times that the child vocalizes/gestures            to a play toy or person, including grunting, shouting, vowel-type sounds e.g., ee, i,            ah, oo u.        Repeated measure one way ANOVA was used to compare the mean difference of using a toy car       for mobility, socialization and development before and after the intervention, and the       follow-up. One way ANOVA was used to compare the mean difference of all developmental tests       mobility, socialization, motor, cognition between two groups before and after the       intervention and the end of follow-up phase. To analyze the learning curve, the results of       socialization will be individually examined for each participant in two groups. The instant       of the maximum training effect will be defined as the moment the top of the learning curve       is reached. This top will be independently determined by two coders through visual       examination of the absolute values. Subsequently, the data set will be split in children       that have reached a maximum effect within the 9 weeks intervention period and those who have       not. These two groups will then be compared with regard to demographic age, gender and       clinical manual ability classification system-MACS, gross motor function classification       system-GMFCS characteristics using X2-test for dichotomous variables and Mann-Whitney U       test/or t-test for the MACS and GMFCS depending on the normality of data. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1. motor delays sd>1.5 resulting in motor impairments that prevented functional              independent mobility, such as rolling, crawling, walking;            2. aged between 12 months to 36 months old;            3. able to tolerate sitting with support for 30 minutes;            4. able to reach the objects with either one or two hands;            5. consent of the parents to agree to the testing procedures and participate in the              training program at their own house or at the hospital.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       We will be recruiting patients with stable angina referred for percutaneous intervention       PCI due to flow limiting coronary artery disease. All patients will be on an existing beta       blocker prescription standard first line angina therapy. Our hypothesis is that Ivabradine       will attenuate microvascular dysfunction post PCI when compared to standard beta-blocker       pre-treatment. We intend to test this in a randomised, open-label parallel arm study with a       direct comparison between Ivabradine and beta-blockers standard therapy. Patients will be       randomised to receive either Ivabradine and stop beta blockers or continue beta blockers       for 6 weeks prior to the PCI procedure. The primary endpoint will be IMR index of       microvascular resistance post PCI, as a marker of microvascular dysfunction and procedural       related myocardial injury. IMR is a potent marker of adverse outcome in STEMI patients and       in ACS after PCI. Although this has yet to be assessed in the elective setting, a reduction       in IMR with Ivabradine may indicate a potential to improve outcomes and lessen iatrogenic       microvascular dysfunction post PCI. IMR is assessed using thermodilution catheters placed       distal to the coronary stenosis and by producing hyperaemia. To assess the medium term       effects on the microcirculation post PCI all patients will have a stress perfusion cardiac       MRI 12 weeks post procedure. The secondary endpoint will be proportion of patients with       coronary flow reserve CFR <2.0 in PCI territory regional myocardial blood flow at       hyperaemia by intravenous adenosine infusion compared to rest. We will also be assessing       CFI collateral flow index, as promotion of the collateral system is one method by which       Ivabradine may lessen procedural related myocardial injury, and ΔIMR as the difference       between IMR pre and post-PCI.        The measurement of cardiac troponins and use of cardiac MRI will facilitate the       identification of peri-procedural myocardial injury and procedural related myocardial       infarction as further secondary end points. The Seattle Angina Questionnaire will be used at       3 intervals to assess symptoms throughout the study. The total study length for each patient       will be 18 weeks.

The main baseline exposures risk factors of interest are the presence of cerebral       microbleeds CMBs on magnetic resonance imaging MRI, and genetic polymorphisms in       candidate genes with potential functional relevance to ICH risk.        Study II: CROMIS-2 ICH Observational and genetics study of intracerebral haemorrhage The       investigators will also recruit 600 patients admitted to participating centres with ICH       with a target of at least 300 anticoagulant-related ICH cases and collect DNA to increase       the power of the genetic studies. The investigators will collect clinical and imaging data       from these ICH cases to investigate risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH       compared to non anticoagulant-related ICH. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background Over the last decade, increasing use of oral anticoagulants to prevent       cardioembolic ischaemic stroke due to atrial fibrillation AF in an ageing population has       led to a five-fold increase in the incidence of anticoagulant-related intracranial       haemorrhage ICH - a rare but unpredictable and catastrophic complication. Cerebral       microbleeds CMBs on magnetic resonance imaging MRI may predict ICH risk, as may genetic       polymorphisms influencing brain small-vessel integrity or anticoagulation stability.        Aims To establish the value of CMBs and genetic factors in predicting symptomatic ICH       following best practice oral anticoagulation to prevent recurrent ischaemic stroke due to       AF.        Methods CROMIS-2: Study I AF - Prospective, multicentre, inception cohort study in 1425       patients with ischaemic stroke due to AF started on best practice oral anticoagulation.       Patients will have genetic testing and standardized MRI including GRE at baseline, with       follow-up by postal questionnaire and clinical assessment or medical records surveillance       after suspected events, and where possible there will be an in person clinical assessment       at 2 years. The investigators will compare the rate of symptomatic ICH between CMB and       CMB-free patients and test for associations with plausible candidate genes. The       investigators aim to develop and validate a risk model to predict symptomatic ICH following       best practice oral anticoagulation to prevent recurrent ischaemic stroke due to AF.        CROMIS-2: Study II ICH - An observational study of ICH investigating genetic, clinical and       radiological risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH. The investigators will       recruit patients admitted to participating centres with ICH with a target of at least 300       anticoagulant-related ICH cases and collect DNA to increase the power of the genetic       studies. The investigators will collect clinical and imaging data from these ICH cases to       investigate risk factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH compared to non       anticoagulant-related ICH.        Expected outcomes A successful predictive model for ICH risk after best practice oral       anticoagulation for AF will help to determine whether genetic or CMB screening should be       used in clinical practice and future trials. New genetic, clinical and radiological risk       factors associated with anticoagulant-related ICH will be identified.

However, the use of these prediction models is not       yet implemented as standard in clinical practice, as it is unknown which delirium prediction       model can best be used to predict delirium in ICU patients.Therefore the main aim of this       study is to compare the performance of the PRE-DELIRIC model and the E-PRE-DELRIC model. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Delirium often occurs in ICU patients and is associated with negative consequences,       requiring prevention. A prediction model facilitates the identification of those patients at       risk for delirium and therefore need prevention the most. At present, two ICU delirium       prediction models are available. First the PRE-DELIRIC model was developed. This recently       recalibrated model reliably predicts ICU patients risk for delirium within 24 hours after       ICU admission. Because a relevant number of patients develops delirium during the first 24       hours after ICU admission, and prevention ideally should be deployed as soon as possible,       the investigators developed the early prediction model E-PRE-DELIRIC which reliably       predicts delirium immediately after ICU admission. To implement a delirium prediction model       in clinical practice, one needs to know which model best can be used. Currently, the use of       a delirium prediction model is not implemented as standard in clinical practice, as this       information is unavailable. Therefore the main aim of this study is to compare the       predictive and clinical performance of the PRE-DELIRIC model and the E-PRE-DELRIC model.

The native       arteriovenous fistula AVF is the preferred vascular access because of the lower thrombosis       and infection risks compared to either synthetic arteriovenous grafts or central venous       catheters. Brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula BCAVF and transposed brachiobasilic       arteriovenous fistula T-BBAVF are recommended when there is either a primary failure or no       suitable vessels for the forearm fistula. However, BCAVF is frequently cannulated at the       antecubital fossa, the risks of stenosis and thrombosis are high, which will compromise       proper BCAVF function and survival. T-BBAVF is not only technically challenging, but also       associates with severe arm swelling and pain. Thus, the investigators introduced a novel       modified Non-transposed brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula mNT-BBAVF for long-term       hemodialysis patients. To confirm its efficacy, a prospective clinical study would be       carried out.

The investigators will test the hypothesis that oxygen concentration during the period of       inspiration FiO2 in the pharynx is dependent on oxygen delivery system design, even at       high flow 15 liters/minute oxygen delivery. Specific measurements include oxygen       concentration at subjects lips and pharynx when breathing 100% oxygen and room air via a       simple mask, non-rebreather mask, OxyMaskTM, and anesthesia mask with headstrap and Jacson       Rees circuit.        A mean difference of 10% pharyngeal FiO2 between any of the masks will be considered       clinically important. The expected standard deviation of the within-subject FiO2 is 3.5%.       With a significance criterion of 0.05, 10 subjects would provide more than 90% power to       detect a mean difference of 10%. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Oxygen therapy refers to the administration of oxygen at higher concentrations than room       air. According to the most recent American Association for Respiratory Care Clinical       Practice Guidelines, indications for supplemental oxygen include hypoxemia, severe trauma,       acute myocardial infarction, short term therapy, and postoperative recovery. Though there       are few contraindications to oxygen therapy, potential complications exist, including       ventilatory depression in hypercarbic patients, absorption atelectasis, and oxygen toxicity       particularly in some patients receiving specific chemotherapeutic agents. In the       spontaneously breathing hypoxemic patient without an endotracheal tube, it is important to       be able to deliver high concentrations of oxygen in order to either avoid intubation or       bridge to intubation. A number of oxygen delivery devices are available that have different       properties that make them useful for different situations.        Variable performance low-flow systems: Low-flow devices are variable performance because       the delivered flow rates are less than the patients peak inspiratory flow rate PIFR and       the oxygen is diluted by room air entrained from around the devices. Higher PIFR e.g.       respiratory distress results in a decrease in the FiO2 delivered through a variable       performance device. Rebreathing of carbon dioxide is also possible with low-flow masks at       lower oxygen flow rates. Variable performance systems include the nasal cannula, simple       mask, partial rebreathing mask, and non-rebreathing mask.        Nasal cannulas are commonly used for stable patients because they are more comfortable, less       irritating to skin, and less anxiety-inducing than masks; they also allow the patient to       eat, talk, and use incentive spirometry. Nasal cannula can provide 24-40% FiO2 with       flow-rates up to 6 L/min. The simple mask is commonly used in the immediate postoperative       setting for supplemental oxygen. Several small holes on either side of the mask as well as       the imperfect seal allow room air to be entrained and exhaled air to escape from the mask.       Simple masks can provide 35-50% FiO2 at flow-rates 5-10 L/min.1 Long-term use of masks can       lead to skin irritation and pressure sores.The partial rebreather consists of a simple mask       with a reservoir bag, and provides 40-70% FiO2 at flow-rates 6-10 L/min.1 The partial       rebreather is no longer used at many hospitals because the range of oxygen delivery can be       encompassed by the simple mask and the non-rebreather. The non-rebreathing mask is similar       to the partial rebreather but includes one-way valves that prevent exhaled air from       returning to the reservoir bag. The non-rebreather can deliver 60-80% FiO2 at 10-15 L/min.1        Fixed performance high-flow systems: By delivering oxygen at a flow rate greater than       PIFR, fixed performance systems make it possible to provide a specified FiO2 throughout the       respiratory cycle. The two commonly used devices are the Venturi mask and OxyMaskTM. Venturi       masks use the Bernoulli principle to deliver oxygen at high flows through a Venturi valve       that has a narrow constriction followed by a wider area with vents that entrain room air.       Because of the relative ease of use and consistent oxygen delivery, they are useful for       patients with COPD or others with chronic hypoxemia. The Venturi mask is able to deliver an       FiO2 of 24-50%.1 Venturi masks will not be tested in this study.        The OxyMaskTM is a relatively new device that uses the Venturi diffuser with a five-pronged       open mask design, which allows the patient to talk and may cause less claustrophobia than       the more closed masks. OxyMaskTM is able to deliver 25-80% FiO2 at flow rates of 1.5-15       L/min. A closed mask with a perfect seal could theoretically deliver 100% FiO2. For the       purposes of this study, a Jackson Rees circuit will be used to deliver oxygen to an       anesthesia mask. The Jackson Rees circuit also called the Mapleson F circuit is routinely       used during transport to deliver oxygen from the oxygen tank to intubated patients. This       circuit consists of tubing connected to a manual ventilation bag that can be squeezed to       deliver pressurized gas flow to the patient. The bag is equipped with an adjustable pressure       limiting valve, which allows the provider to control the pressure delivered by squeezing the       bag.        Measurement of FiO2: It has been established that FiO2 achieved with nasal cannula does not       differ significantly whether the subject breathes through their mouth or nose. This property       has not been established for masks. With a closed mask, FiO2 achieved would also be the same       regardless of mouth or nose-breathing. With an open mask, the assumption must be made that       oxygen concentration is equal at the nose and the mouth in order to ensure equivalence of       mouth and nose-breathing. Also, previous studies on oxygen delivery systems have used a       variety of methods for measuring FiO2. From a review of the literature of the oxygen       delivery devices discussed above, only the nasal cannula has been studied by measurement of       oxygen at the level of the pharynx, whereas the other masks have been studied by measurement       of oxygen at the lips.        Study Rationale: The studies on OxyMaskTM determined FiO2 based on gas sampled at the lips.       However, due to the possibility of gas mixing and/or nasal breathing with the open mask       design, it is unclear if the gas sampled at the lips is the same gas that arrives at the       trachea, which is the most clinically relevant location. The gas inspired from the trachea       is what is actually seen by the alveoli and participates in oxygenation of the blood. Gas       mixing would seem more likely with an open mask design such as the OxyMask. A study       comparing pharyngeal FiO2 between masks would more accurately demonstrate the effective FiO2       than the currently available data. This in turn, will better inform perioperative clinicians       of the best approach to maximize oxygen delivery to our critically ill post-operative       patients who require supplemental oxygen to treat or prevent systemic hypoxia.        Study Design: The investigators will measure steady state FiO2 in the pharynx and at the       lips simultaneously on each subject as they undergo each of the following oxygen delivery       conditions sequentially: 1 room air; 2 high flow oxygen and simple mask; 3 high flow       oxygen and non-rebreather mask; 4 high flow oxygen and OxyMask; and 5 high flow oxygen and       anesthesia mask with head-strap and Jackson Rees circuit.        Study Population: The study will include up to 20 subjects. A mean difference of 10%       pharyngeal FiO2 between any of the masks will be considered clinically important. The       expected standard deviation of the within-subject FiO2 is 3.5%. With a significance       criterion of 0.05, 10 subjects would provide more than 90% power to detect a mean difference       of 10%.        Setting: The study will take place in a fully equipped operating room with an anesthesia       machine that has been approved for patient use by Infection Control and Biomedical       Engineering. It is located in the South OR area of Kohler Pavilion at OHSU and is equipped       with the Datex Ohmeda anesthesia machine and Poet Gas Analyzer that will be used for the       study. The study will be conducted after hours to avoid any conflict with surgical patient       care. The oxygen sensors will be calibrated before each subject is tested.        Recruitment: Subjects will be recruited from OHSUs perioperative service. Advertisement       flyers will be distributed in each operating room location.        Consent: The consent process will be undertaken by individuals with appropriate human       subjects protection and HIPPA education, and performed in person on the OHSU campus or on       the phone. Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time.        Procedures: The subjects will each participate on one study day and will require one hour       per subject. Subjects will remain NPO for at least 6 hours prior to their study period.       Subject characteristics will be recorded. The anesthesia machine will be turned on and the       oxygen sensor on the gas analyzer will be calibrated. Baseline vital signs HR, BP, SpO2       will be measured. FEV1 and FVC will be measured with the anesthesia machine and a standard       circuit, using the Y-piece as the mouthpiece. The following protocol for gas sampling will       be used: One gas sampling line will be attached at one end to the gas analyzer and at the       other end to an 8 French suction catheter, which will be lubricated with 2% lidocaine jelly.       This nasal catheter will be inserted through a nare, with the tip position immediately       behind the uvula. Placement will be confirmed by visualizing the tip of the catheter using a       penlight and having the subject open the mouth widely and say, Ah. If required, a tongue       depressor will be used. If the catheter cannot be visualized, then it will be inserted to a       standard depth of 9-10cm. The nasal catheter will be taped to the subjects face. A second       gas sampling line will be taped to the subjects face and positioned so that sampling occurs       at the patients lips. After placement of the two sampling catheters is confirmed, the       subject will breathe room air normally for 90 seconds and FiO2 will be measured over a       period of 30 seconds. The subject will not be instructed whether to use their nose or mouth       to breathe, since patients in the hospital typically not instructed which way to breathe.       Afterward, testing of the various oxygen masks will be performed with oxygen set at high       flow 15L/min through simple mask, non-rebreather mask, OxyMask, and anesthesia mask with       headstrap and Jackson Rees circuit. Since the auxiliary oxygen dial on the anesthesia       machine only goes up to 10L/min, a 15L/min adjustable oxygen valve will be attached directly       to the main oxygen supply line in the operating room. After placement of each mask and       starting oxygen high flow, the subject will breathe normally for 90 seconds and then FiO2       will be measured over the next 30 seconds, similarly to the room air control. At the end of       each trial period, each subject will be asked to take a single vital capacity breath       starting with maximum exhalation and followed by maximum inhalation. Between testing of       each mask, there will be a five minute period of breathing room air as a washout period and       to confirm stability of hemodynamic status measurement of BP and HR. Demographic data to       be obtained includes height cm, weight kg, age, gender, and self-declared ethnicity.       Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation will be recorded at baseline and prior to       and following each mask-trial. Baseline FEV1/FVC measurement will be conducted on all       patients prior to initiating the study and recorded. FiO2 data will be downloaded digitally       from the gas analyzer to an excel spreadsheet. If this is not possible, then oxygen       percentage will be manually recorded during each breath to determine the range of oxygen       percentages minimal and maximal during both phases of ventilation, during the 30 second       measurement period. Respiratory rate during measurement time will also be recorded. At the       end of the 30 second sampling period, a final measurement will be taken during a forced       vital capacity breath.        Data Analysis: Phase of ventilation will be defined using the capnography tracing, which is       displayed concurrently with measurement of inspired oxygen. Maximal and minimal oxygen       concentration will be averaged for inspiration, during the 30 second mask breathing trial,       for each subject. These values will be averaged across the group for each intervention to       define statistics for the entire group. Values recorded during normal tidal volume       ventilation will be analyzed separately from values recorded during each forced vital       capacity ventilation. The Analysis of Variance test and appropriate post-hoc analysis will       be used to determine the difference between FiO2 administered by each mask tested.

Only modest improvements of outcomes have been observed with the current       available advanced specific drug therapy. Pulmonary hypertension advanced therapy is also       expensive and leads to frequent adverse effects, sometimes serious. Results from a pilot       study, the first-in-man experience of pulmonary artery denervation, demonstrated a clinical       improvement in 13 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension despite optimal medical       management. However this single non-randomized study requires confirmation.        The investigators propose a prospective multi-center, randomized, single-blinded trial. Its       main objective will be to assess, in patients with uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension       despite optimal medical management, the efficacy of pulmonary artery denervation in reducing       mean pulmonary artery pressure mPAP at six months, compared to continued medical treatment       following a simulated sham procedure.        The principal evaluation criteria will be the mPAP change in mm Hg as measured by right       heart catheterization.        The study will run for 18 months and it will be necessary to recruit 50 patients.

However, despite this, there is currently a worrying       lack of support for new mothers, with data suggesting that 64% of healthcare trusts in the       UK do not have a strategy for treating PND, and flaws in the current pharmacological and       psychological treatment models. Consequently, research into promising psychosocial       interventions such as music is critical to developing new paradigms for treating PND.        Singing away the Blues is an ambitious programme of research that investigates links between       the mental health of women in the later stages of pregnancy and first 9 months post birth       and their use of psychosocial interventions including music. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The study uses an online questionnaire to achieve a cross-sectional view of the mental       health of women across England in the final stages of pregnancy and the first 9 months post       birth, how much and in what ways music is used by these women, and whether there are any       associations between music and mental health. The study aims to recruit 1,000 women to take       the anonymous questionnaire. However, women who complete the questionnaire while still       pregnant will be invited to complete three further questionnaires shortly post-birth and 3       months later to gather longitudinal data to analyse change across pregnancy into post-birth       aiming for 500 of the 1,000 undertaking this repeated measurement.        Phase A of the study will be open to NHS sites around England to take part.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02527499","TITLE:       The Effects of Combining Modified ride-on Cars With Bimanual Training on Enhancing Mobility, Socialization, Motor Function and Participation in Toddlers With Disabilities SUMMARY:       The four purposes of this study are: 1 to examine the feasibility of combining modified       ride-on cars with bimanual training ROCBT on mobility, socialization and motor function in       toddlers with disabilities; 2 to quantify whether toddlers with disabilities are able to       have more manual explorations and social interactions with ROCBT through observation and       wrist-worn accelerometers; 3 to determine the critical factors of using the modified       ride-on toy car on family perceptions and participation.        Independent mobility is believed to be essential for perceptual-motor, cognition, language       and social skill development. It is important to increase independent mobility in toddlers       with disabilities and further enhance their development, especially socialization. Assistive       and power mobility devices allow toddlers with disabilities to move independently within       their environment and may increase the opportunities to explore and interact with people and       environment. However, issues to consider before prescribing an assistive device include       factors such as age, accessibly to community environments, cost, and social acceptance of       the device and the adaptability of the device to growth. To address these limitations and       meet toddlers needs, the concept of using modified ride-on toy cars in therapy becomes a       novel application. Study has demonstrated the use of toy cars enhanced a childs motivation,       socialization and family participation. This study is further to combine the use of       customized, modified ride-on toy cars with bimanual training, to enhance the independent       mobility, manual exploration and socialization through low-cost, family-centered approach.       It will also improve familys understanding of childrens capabilities, which improve their       development.        Investigators will recruit 75 children with who are between 1 to 3 years old and diagnosed       as motor delay >1.5 sd. They will be randomly assigned to one of the following three       groups: ROCBT treatment group, early mobility training group and regular therapy group. The       whole study duration will be 18 weeks, including 9-week intervention and 9-week follow-up;       the total amount of treatment will be equal for two groups. Standardized assessments are       provided for a total of three times during the study, including the time before and after       the intervention and in the end of the follow-up phase. The ROCBT and early mobility       training programs will be administered by the therapist and include 120 minutes/per session,       2 sessions/per week. The research team will visit the hospital once/per week to provide 60       minutes videotaping and wearing wrist-worn accelerometers. The regular therapy group will       continue their regular therapy without any additional car driving training. The research       team will visit them once/per week for the assessments. The assessments include standardized       measurements and behavior coding from the videotapes and accelerometers. The findings of       this study will help to understand the feasibility and effectiveness of combining the       low-tech modified ride-on cars with bimanual training on advancing childrens mobility and       socialization. They can be used in the clinic or school and are a low cost alternative or       addition to other mobility devices. They may provide a novel therapeutic tool to improve       mobility, socialization, family participation and development. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Spontaneous self-initiated actions have consequences, and experiencing these is very       educational. Independent mobility is believed to be essential for perceptual-motor and       social skill development. Self-produced locomotion is an organizer of psychological changes       in children with typical development, especially developmental changes in perceptions,       social understanding, spatial cognitive, and emotions. In addition, through active manual       exploration, children can detect the object and individuals information that relates size,       orientation, shape, substance to their perceptual and movement capabilities and       interpersonal relationships. Children require exploratory behaviors to gather relevant       information for a task. They can learn the relationship between the object-surface and       movements through increased independent mobility and manual exploration. There is convincing       evidence that the use of powered mobility for children with disabilities has positive       impacts on their overall development and increases their exploration. Studies are focusing       on reducing the limitations in the areas of social, cognitive, perceptual, and functional       development that were induced by lack of independent mobility in early ages. Limited       evidence also demonstrated that early powered mobility training had positive impacts on the       family participation, including decreasing parents level of stress and increasing their       satisfaction with their childs sleep patterns, ability to move out, and ability to interact       and socialize with the family.        Pediatric rehabilitation, through training and assertive technology AT, seeks to provide       children with disabilities with the same level of mobility, exploration, socialization and       participation for children with typical development TD. Proponents of powered vehicles for       very young children present strong reasons for introducing powered mobility to children at a       time in their developmental pattern that coincides as closely as possible to when they would       have begun independent mobility as a child with TD. Research has suggested that there is no       negative influence on motor development or self-care abilities. In addition, children with       disabilities may be more motivated to participate in therapy and may demonstrate increased       head, trunk and arm-hand control for exploration in the surrounding environment. However, up       to date, the lack of rigorous studies and limited evidence of the increased independent       mobility and early child development across all three International Classification of       Functioning, Disability and Health ICF levels, still signify the needs of considering       early power mobility as a feasible intervention in the clinical settings for very young       children who have not yet achieved a means of independent mobility and are unlikely to       achieve it.        There are many basic barriers to achieving this high standard and no single AT or       combination of AT can currently provide the level of mobility and exploration that children,       families and therapists desire. Currently, the most critical barrier to including power       mobility in EI programs is the lack of readily available power chairs for children younger       than 2-3 years of age, the period when mobility is rapidly developing for children with       typical development. Certain characteristics of the most common commercial pediatric power       wheelchairs limit their use in the home and community spaces such as playgrounds. These       limitations include price e.g., typically >$5000, size and weight e.g., typically >150       lbs, transportation requirements e.g., van or truck, maintenance and aesthetics and       social acceptance. Experimental power mobility devices PMD have the potential to address       some of these limitations such as size, weight and infant use. Unfortunately these are       likely years from commercial availability. Moreover, power wheelchairs have historically       been designed to address a limited set of goals related to mobility with minimal       consideration of socialization. Investigators believe there is a need for readily available       mobility options for immediate use by very young children and their families that address       some of the above limitations while expanding the role of PMD past simply mobility and into       socialization.        There are four strengths of using ride-on toy cars for mobility. First, the cost is       comparable or less than most mobility devices. Second, most are relatively lightweight,       small and easily transported in contrast to power chairs. Third, the child-friendly,       colorful toy designs are more acceptable to adults and children and likely seen as simply a       toy. This may be an important aspect for clinicians wanting to start early power mobility       training with families hesitant to discuss powered chair options. Fourth, because toy cars       are simple electromagnetically devices, they can be modified quickly and easily to match the       childs current and/or future abilities and goals. The use of modified ride-on toy cars may       provide a readily available, convenient and fun way for families, therapists and early       educators to help young children improve their mobility starting within the first years of       life.        From our initial pilot results, it indicated that this early powered mobility training       through the use of modified toy cars might enhance cognition, language, mobility, and       socialization in toddlers with mobility impairments. However, the fine and gross motor       remained at a similar level before and after 9-week intervention. These initial findings       suggest a number of important points: 1 early power mobility training may increase       exploratory behaviors and benefit independent mobility, cognitive and social development; 2       the improvements of childrens development and caregivers involvement in the training may       decrease family stress level and increase family participation; 3 simple early power       mobility training may not be enough to improve motor function. Better postural control       coupled with reaching and grasping ability allows infants to independently explore objects       in new ways for sustained periods through mouthing and touching. The seat adjustments e.g.,       a seat belt er, a hip strap of ride-on toy cars may provide sufficient postural stability       for the child with disabilities, however, the impaired reaching and grasping ability may       decrease the opportunities of doing manual exploration for both hands. Most daily activities       are functional tasks and may require two hands doing different actions. The development of       increased functional independence requires use of both hands in cooperation. Gordon et al.       had asked caregivers to identify goals for the intervention, and measured the progress using       goal-attainment scale GAS. Nearly 85% of the goals were bimanual. Principles of motor       learning practice specificity suggest the most functional way to balance the cortical       activity and improve bi-manual control would be to practice bi-manual activities directly.        Bi-manual training is an approach often used by clinicians treating the upper extremity       function. It appears to be better for improving bi-manual coordination and goal performance.       Andersen et al. suggested that bi-manual training may be better for a child with mild       impairments, or for a child without grasping abilities in one hand as tasks can be graded       such that the hand can be used as passive assist to begin. Most importantly, bi-manual       activities may be more motivating as they are generally more ecologically relevant and may       be selected to maximize interest. Studies showed that intensive bi-manual training can       significantly improve the quality and quantity of bi-manual hand use in children with       hemispheric CP. It focuses on improving the coordination of both upper extremities through       functional and play activities, and requires active problem solving for children to discover       their bi-manual capabilities. Active discovery-learning and problem solving are principles       of learning within a perception-action framework and can promote neural plasticity.       Bi-manual training may allow direct practice of functional meaningful goals, and such       practice can transfer to unpracticed goals and improve manual, exploratory learning.        Theoretically, using powered mobility combined with increased manual exploration as part of       a comprehensive Early Intervention EI program within the first three years of life should       not only provide mobility but also reduce secondary impairments for children with       disabilities. Although of increasing interest, there is very little empirical evidence of       the effects or even feasibility of early power mobility training on the family participation       and overall development, particularly for mobility and socialization. Furthermore, up to       date, there is no evidence on examining the effects of applying early PMD combining with       bi-manual training on the active discovery-learning and upper extremity function for young       children with disabilities. Our case report was the first study showing positive effects of       using a ride-on car on mobility and socialization in a child with severe CP. The pilot       results of the previous study also demonstrated positive impacts of implementing early       ride-on car training on cognition, language, and mobility for toddlers with disabilities. It       also helped to decrease the caregivers stress level. However, motor function tended to be       at the similar level before and after the 9-week intervention. In addition, little is known       about the learning curve of using the PMD to improve development, e.g., at what point in       time maximal effects are reached. Up to now, most of the studies have focused on the end       results of increased amount of independent mobility in daily life. It is still unknown       whether optimal maximal effects are being reached at all and which factors might influence       the learning curve as well as the retention of treatment effects in the long term. To       improve the overall development, investigators hypothesize that combining modified ride-on       toy cars with bi-manual training ROCBT may benefit the toddlers development on cognition,       socialization and motor, especially for the manual exploration. Furthermore, this combined       training may improve the toddlers goal performance, enhance the familys perception on the       childs capabilities and increase the function at participation level.        In this study, investigators will modify ride-on toy cars for children with disabilities for       use in clinical settings as part of a 18-week power mobility training program. In addition,       investigators will combine this ride-on toy use with bi-manual training and compare the       results to the regular therapy. Investigators will focus on four research questions.       Specifically, can investigators: 1 use the modified toy cars and combine it with bi-manual       training as an effective power mobility training program to improve the exploratory       behaviors and overall development; 2 select a set of dependent measures that quantify       whether the children increase their exploratory behaviors; 3 determine the factors that       influence familys perception on the environment, child and themselves; 4 conduct a       hospital-based, power mobility training program that results in a high level of fun for the       child and compliance by the family and therapists. If our results are generally positive and       show significant differences among ROCBT, early powered mobility training and regular       therapy, it will provide us some alternative ways either to improve the overall development       or merely independent mobility and socialization. Subsequently, the future randomized       controlled trial studies could further quantify the effectiveness and the feasibility with       different treatment intensity and various pediatric populations.        The specific aims of this study are: 1 to examine the feasibility of combining modified       ROCBT on mobility, socialization and motor function in toddlers with disabilities; 2 to       quantify whether toddlers with disabilities are able to have more manual explorations and       social interactions with ROCBT through observation and wrist-worn accelerators; 3 to       determine the critical factors of using the modified ride-on toy car on family perceptions       and participation. Through the comparison among ROCBT, early powered mobility training and       regular therapy groups, investigators hypothesize that ROCBT group will have more       improvements on mobility, socialization and motor functions than the early powered mobility       training and the control groups. Children in the ROCBT group will have more physical       activity for manual explorations and social interactions, in comparison to the early powered       mobility group, due to the combined bi-manual training. In addition, investigators       hypothesize that ROCBT will elicit different family perceptions on the childs capabilities       and themselves, in comparison to the early powered mobility training and regular therapy.        Study Design: A pretest-post-test control group design will be applied. Three groups will be       involved in this project: hospital-based, modified ride-on cars combined with bi-manual       training program ROCBT, early powered mobility training program and regular therapy       program. The participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups by using the       well-sealed, opaque envelopes when they are recruited in the study. Once the participants       are recruited in the study, the research team will modify a toy car based on each       participants capabilities during this pre-intervention phase the first two or three weeks       before intervention starts, e.g., seat and steering wheel modifications. The study duration       for each participant is 18 weeks, including 9-week intervention and 9-week follow-up.        Participants in the study will be 75 toddlers ages 12 months to 36 months with motor delays       sd > 1.5. They will be randomly assigned to either the powered mobility combined with       bi-manual training group 25 toddlers, 25 early powered mobility training group 25       toddlers or the regular therapy group 25 toddlers. The age group of infants/preschool       children is selected based on the previous studies on early power mobility training in       infants and preschool children. Power mobility training is typically offered to children       between two and six years of age, with three years being the average age of the youngest       child being recommended for a powered chair. However, studies showed that early power       mobility training was feasible for 7-month-old infants and 18-month-old children with       mobility disabilities. The participants performance is indicative of the extent to which       early power mobility training is feasible for both young infants and up to 3-year-old child       with disabilities.        Recruitment: The children were recruited from self-referrals, health care practitioners, or       the hospitals in Taipei and Taoyuan, Taiwan where children with motor delays >1.5 sd were       receiving outpatient rehabilitation. The research team initially posted flyers describing       the study at clinical settings and contacted the therapists in the clinical settings to       introduce the goals,criteria and general procedure of the study. Parents/guardians obtained       information about the study through the flyers and their therapists. Parents/guardians, who       were interested and whose children met the criteria of diagnosis, age, capability determined       by the doctor and their therapists, were given contact information for the investigator.       After receiving contact information, the research team contacted the parents/guardian and/or       therapists for scheduling a date of further testing by the research team at the hospital.       When the research team contacted the parents, study was explained and parents received a       letter detailing the procedure and given an opportunity to ask questions. Parents/guardians       signed this informed consent form at the time of the first visit.        Procedure: Before the preintervention assessments, the research team will modify the cars       seat and acceleration to the hand switch-driven, which allows the car to be derivable for       the child who meets the inclusion criteria. Each child will have a customized ride-on toy       car in the ROCBT and early powered mobility training groups. After modifications, they will       receive preintervention assessments, including behavioral videotaping and developmental       assessments. The developmental assessments will occur at the first and last week of the       9-week intervention, and the end of the 9-week follow-up phase. A therapist who does not       involve in the intervention and is blinded to the study purpose will complete all the       developmental tests. The driving and socialization behaviors will be videotaped by the       research team for 1 hour/per session, one session/per week before, during and after the       intervention phase at the hospital. In addition, participants will wear two accelerators on       their wrists to monitor the physical activity during the 1 hour videotaping session. All       videotapes will be coded by two independent coders, who are undergraduate students. Prior to       making their ratings, the coder is instructed as to coding procedures by the PI, but he/she       is not informed about the group assignment and the purpose of the study. Cohens kappa       coefficient will be calculated between the two independent raters to establish good       reliability before formal coding.        Intervention: The research team will ask caregivers to identify goals before intervention,       and measure progress using goal-attainment scaling GAS before and after the intervention       for the three groups. Ride-On Cars with Bi-manual Training Program ROCBT: The research       team will ask caregivers to identify goals before intervention, and measure progress using       goal-attainment scaling GAS. Investigators will discuss with the clinical therapists who       will provide training program in a hospital for 2 hours/per session, 2 sessions/per week for       a total of 9-week intervention. Each week the research team will videotape the childs       natural play and driving performance for the first hour of training session during the       intervention phase. The 2-hour training session is composed of two 30-minute driving       sessions and two 30-minute bi-manual training sessions. Each 30-minute driving training is       followed by one 30-minute bi-manual training. Every weeks treatment program will       pre-planned and adjusted by the occupational therapist and the caregivers through discussion       and clinical observation of participants performance in the previous session. Training will       still concentrate on building the concept of casual-effect on the switch and car motion,       goal-oriented driving in a hospital, and bi-manual use in functional tasks for exploration       in bi-manual training, discussed by the family, the treating therapist and the research       team.        The car driving training includes 2 phases: I-car exploration and II-prompted driving.       Participants can learn how to move and stop the car in the car exploration phase. Through       prompted driving in phase II, they can use the car as a mean to explore environments e.g.,       to the elevator, to different stores and contact with people e.g., drive to the caregiver       and get the toy. Bi-manual training involves activities which include perceptual motor       tasks e.g., smear both hands with color, holding and manipulative tasks e.g., cutting toy       vegetables or fruits, posture and balance e.g., pull a cart, and self-care and activities       of daily living e.g., drinking water from a cup with two handles.        Early Mobility Training Program: Most of the guidelines are similar with ROCBT, except for       the bi-manual training. The therapist and family will merely focus on independent mobility       training and improving socialization. The training time and period is the same as ROCBT.        Regular Therapy Program: The regular therapy group will continue the regular therapy,       including physical, occupational and speech therapy. The general propose of the training is       to improve the developmental scales, mobility, socialization and upper limb use in       functional tasks. The research team will videotape the childs natural play and driving       performance at the hospital for 1 hour/per session, 1 session/per week during the 9-week       intervention phase.        Follow-up: This period will focus on the 9-week follow-up after receiving a treatment       program. No treatment programs will be delivered to the participants. The research team will       still videotape the childs natural play and driving performance at the hospital for 1 hour       /per session, 1 session/per week during the 9-week follow-up phase.        Instrument and Procedure: Each participant will receive pre-intervention assessments,       including behavioral videotaping and developmental assessments. Behavioral coding involved       the mobility/driving performance during the 10-minute Car Play and socialization during the       whole 20-minute Play i.e., 10-minute Natural Play and 10-minute Car Play. The       developmental assessments occurred at the first and last week of 9-week intervention, and       the end of the 9-week follow-up phase, including the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability       Inventory PEDI, the Bayley Scales of Development, Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2nd ,       Goal Attainment Scale GAS, The Affordances in the Home Environment for Motor Development       AHEMD, and Parenting Stress Index PSI. Necessary materials include two video cameras, a       parent log and a customized ride-on car.        Data Reduction and Analysis: All videotapes will be coded by two independent coders, who are       undergraduate students. Prior to making their ratings, the coder is instructed as to coding       procedures, but he/she is not informed about the group assignment and the purpose of the       study.        Mobility Measures: The following measures will be obtained via video coding the 10-minute       Car Play during pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention phases to determine the       feasibility of learning to drive the car:          1. Driving Categories time in seconds: a. Independent Mobility: When the child            independently drives the car preceded by an independent switch contact without an            adults assistance. b. Assisted Mobility: When an adult puts the childs hand on the            switch but he independently pushes the switch to begin driving. c. Caregiver Mobility:            When the child drove with an adults hand directly on top of his hand.          2. Visual Attention to Switch: The frequency number of times that the child looked at            the switch during the 10-minute driving.          3. Stopping Categories number of times divided by total times goal was presented: a.            Independent Stop: When the child independently moves his hand off the switch and makes            the car stop within one car length of the goal location. b. Stops with Verbal Cues:            When the child moves his hand off the switch as the car arrives the goal only after            verbal cues given from an adult. c. Stops with Tactile Contacts: When the child moves            his hand off the switch as the car arrives the goal only after tactile cues e.g.,            touching his hand or moving his hand off the switch given from an adult.        Socialization Measures: To examine the impact of independent mobility on the socialization       during the 10- minute Natural Play and 10-minute Car Play, the following measures will be       obtained via coding video footage during pre-intervention, intervention and       post-intervention:          1. Reaching for toy/person: The frequency number of times that the child initially            extends arms to the play toy/interacting person.          2. Initiation of contact with others: peer-directed or adult-directed: Target            child-initiated contacts with others are counted whenever two conditions are met: a            the target child initiates the contact with another individual without any observable            prompting or initiating behavior on the part of another person and b the target child            independently vocalizes with either comprehensible words or other vocalizations,            including shouting, laughing, grunting, etc. or physically points to, touches, or            indicates that he or she wants something from another individual. Target            child-initiated contacts and vocalizations are divided into two categories: i            peer-directed and ii adult-directed.          3. Other initiated contacts: contact by peers or by adults: Peer-initiated contacts are            defined as any child initiating any type of contact with the target child e.g.,            talking to the child, touching the child or a mobility device the child is using,            giving a toy or item to the child, taking a toy or item away from the child.            Adult-initiated contacts with the target child are: a carrying, moving, or otherwise            touching the child or the device in which the child is seated e.g., swing, wheelchair,            toy car; b taking a toy or item away from the child.          4. Facial Expression: The frequency number of times of both positive and negative facial            expressions appeared during interaction. Positive was determined to include smiling and            laughing. Negative was determined to include discomfort, crying and unhappy facial            expression.          5. Vocalization/Gesture: The frequency number of times that the child vocalizes/gestures            to a play toy or person, including grunting, shouting, vowel-type sounds e.g., ee, i,            ah, oo u.        Repeated measure one way ANOVA will be used to compare the mean difference of using a toy       car for mobility, socialization and development before and after the intervention, and after       9-week follow-up, i.e., within group comparison. One way ANOVA will be used to compare the       mean difference of all developmental tests mobility, socialization, motor, and cognition,       participation and physical activity for exploration among three groups before and after the       intervention and the end of follow-up phase. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            1. motor delays sd>1.5 resulting in motor impairments that prevented functional              independent mobility, such as rolling, crawling, walking;            2. aged between 12 months to 36 months old            3. able to tolerate sitting with support for 30 minutes            4. able to reach the objects with either one or two hands            5. consent of the parents to agree to the testing procedures and participate in the              training program at the hospital.          Exclusion Criteria:            1. children with severe sensory impairments such as blindness, deafness            2. parents/caregivers are not able to make a time commitment for the training phase ");

The need for diagnostic tests or therapeutic       interventions is much greater in this patient population. Cardiovascular diseases and       symptoms represent 12% of the causes for emergency room admission, and patients suffering       from cardiovascular disease are those whose emergency room visit lasts longest.        The diagnostic approach in the emergency room in elderly patients admitted for acute       dypsnoea is complex, and early identification of acute left-sided heart failure ALSHF is       vital as it has an impact on prognosis. The clinical signs are difficult to interpret, and       are non-specific, particularly at the acute phase and in elderly or obese patients. Indeed,       some authors have reported up to 50% of diagnostic errors in elderly patients.        Measure of the blood concentration of a natriuretic peptide allows a quick diagnosis.       However, peptides suffer from several limitations, particularly in situations that are often       encountered in elderly patients, such as sepsis, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome,       pulmonary embolism, chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation and high body mass       index. Diagnostic performance deteriorates with increasing age, and there is a significant       increase in this grey-zone in patients aged ≥75 years. In critical situations in elderly       patients, assessment of natriuretic peptides serve mainly to rule out a diagnosis of left       heart failure.        Some authors have suggested using lung ultrasound in the initial work-up of acute       respiratory failure, since some specific profiles are known to be related to the presence of       interstitial oedema, reflecting impaired left heart function e.g. presence of B lines.       These studies were performed in the context of intensive or critical care, but data are       sparse regarding the application of this approach in the emergency room.        The hypothesis is that the diagnostic accuracy of a targeted and quick echographic approach,       namely the READ method Rapid Echography for Acute Dyspnoea, comprising targeted lung       ultrasound combined with isolated measure of transmitral flow, would be superior to that of       NT-proBNP assessment for the diagnosis of ALSHF in elderly patients ≥75 years admitted to       the emergency department. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The number of emergency room visits is constantly increasing, and it is therefore necessary       to minimize the duration of each visit, thereby increasing the efficacy of the diagnostic       process, leading to quicker orientation of each patient for appropriate care. In this       context, accurate triage and a quick initial diagnostic work-up are of paramount importance       in achieving this goal.        Elderly people constitute the largest proportion of emergency room patients, representing       12% of all emergency room admissions. The need for diagnostic tests or therapeutic       interventions is much greater in this patient population, with 4 out of 5 patients requiring       such measures. Indeed, elderly persons often suffer from multiple diseases that require a       greater number of tests source: Direction de la recherche, des études, de lévaluation et       des statistiques DREES, emergency room survey 1.        Cardiovascular diseases and symptoms represent 12% of the causes for emergency room       admission, and patients suffering from cardiovascular disease are those whose emergency room       visit lasts longest. Indeed, almost 50% of patients with cardiovascular disease stay more       than 4 hours in the emergency room, according to a French national survey published in July       2014.        The diagnostic approach in the emergency room in elderly patients admitted for acute       dypsnoea is complex, and early identification of acute left-sided heart failure ALSHF is       vital as it has an impact on prognosis.        Acute dyspnoea and acute respiratory insufficiency are frequent causes of admission to the       emergency room. The etiological diagnosis is difficult, especially in elderly patients who       often have a history of cardio-respiratory disease 2345. In this specific       population, there are often numerous comorbidities, such as chronic respiratory failure,       chronic renal failure, and ischemic heart disease 6. In addition, acute respiratory       insufficiency can be caused by a range of distinct pathologies, such as acute heart failure,       pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD, pleural effusion or       pulmonary embolism. There is thus clearly a pressing need for an accurate and early       diagnosis of the correct etiology in these patients, particularly to identify ALSHF, a       condition that requires immediate initiation of appropriate therapy in order to improve       prognosis. In these patients, studies have shown that inappropriate or delayed therapy in       the emergency room is an independent predictor of death 237.        The European Society of Cardiology ESC recently published a review of the standard       diagnostic methods for ALSHF, describing the advantages and limitations of each clinical       examination, electrocardiogram ECG, chest x-ray, NT-proBNP assessment 8.        The clinical signs are difficult to interpret, and are non-specific, particularly at the       acute phase and in elderly or obese patients 9. Indeed, some authors have reported up to       50% of diagnostic errors in elderly patients 10.        Chest x-ray, which is usually performed in the emergency room, is not specific because of       the conditions in which it is performed in emergency situations. Generally, the       pre-requisites for proper implementation are not fully respected because of the emergency       nature of the exam, and chest x-ray is therefore primarily useful for differential diagnosis       only 8.        Early echocardiography is recommended in patients presenting to the hospital in an emergency       with suspected heart failure HF and acute onset of symptoms. Imaging techniques play a       central role in the diagnosis of HF and in guiding treatment. Among the several imaging       modalities available, echocardiography is the method of choice in patients with suspected HF       for reasons of accuracy, availability including portability, safety and cost. The term       echocardiography is used here to refer to all cardiac ultrasound imaging techniques,       including two- or three-dimensional echocardiography, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler,       colour flow Doppler, and tissue Doppler imaging. For assessment of left ventricular systolic       and diastolic dysfunction, no single echocardiographic parameter is sufficiently accurate       and reproducible to be used in isolation. Therefore, a comprehensive echocardiographic       examination incorporating all relevant two-dimensional and Doppler data is recommended. This       should include the evaluation of both structural and functional abnormalities.        However, this type of specialised echocardiography is not routinely available in most       emergency rooms. In routine practice, systematic specialised echocardiography by a       cardiologist for all cases of acute respiratory failure is not feasible due to the lack of       trained operators. Indeed, training in specialised echocardiography is not a pre-requisite       to become a qualified emergency room physician in France. Lastly, specialised       echocardiography exams are time-consuming and incompatible with the need to manage the vast       flow of patients through a busy emergency room.        An alternative approach to diagnosis is to measure the blood concentration of a natriuretic       peptide, a family of hormones secreted in increased amounts when the heart is diseased or       the load on any chamber is increased 111213141516. However, peptides suffer from       several limitations, particularly in situations that are often encountered in elderly       patients, such as sepsis, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism,       chronic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation and high body mass index 17. Diagnostic       performance deteriorates with increasing age, and there is a significant increase in this       grey-zone in patients aged ≥75 years 8161819. In critical situations in elderly       patients, assessment of natriuretic peptides serve mainly to rule out a diagnosis of left       heart failure 81619.        Some authors have suggested using lung ultrasound in the initial work-up of acute       respiratory failure 20212223242526, since some specific profiles are known to       be related to the presence of interstitial oedema, reflecting impaired left heart function       e.g. presence of B lines 2728. These studies were performed in the context of       intensive or critical care, but data are sparse regarding the application of this approach       in the emergency room.        In a preliminary, single-centre study, the utility of a quick transthoracic echography       approach was investigated, namely the READ method Rapid Echography for Acute Dyspnoea,       which associated targeted lung ultrasound and measure of transmitral flow in 51 patients       aged ≥75 years. When performed at the patients admission to the emergency room, the READ       method was showed to have a sensitivity of 95% for the identification of ALSHF. Indeed,       analysis of transmitral flow is easily available by transthoracic echography. The presence       of a restrictive pattern in case of acute dypsnoea is associated with the existence of       ALSHF 2930313233.        Echography is a diagnostic tool whose use in the emergency room is increasing exponentially.       For example, the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma FAST ultrasound assessment       technique in trauma patients has become the cornerstone of initial triage in trauma       patients. The idea is to use targeted ultrasound, not necessarily performed by a specialist,       to achieve accurate triage of patients in only a few minutes to guide subsequent diagnostic       and therapeutic approaches.        There is a paucity of well-conducted studies in the literature evaluating the utility of       targeted chest ultrasound in the diagnostic work-up of acute dyspnoea in elderly patients       admitted to the emergency department. There currently exists no consensus regarding the use       of echography in these patients, and its use largely depends on the competency and       availability of operators in the emergency, in the absence of formal evidence proving its       utility. Biomarkers such as brain natriuretic peptide BNP or NT-proBNP lack sensitivity in       this age-category of patients, although they are widely used in routine practice given the       impossibility of rapid, and 24/7 access to specialised echocardiography.        In this context, the study hypothesis is that the diagnostic accuracy of a targeted and       quick echographic approach, namely the READ method Rapid Echography for Acute Dyspnoea,       comprising targeted lung ultrasound combined with isolated measure of transmitral flow,       would be superior to that of NT-proBNP assessment for the diagnosis of ALSHF in elderly       patients ≥75 years admitted to the emergency department.

Overall, AC mycelia consumption for 8 weeks       could successfully reduce mean diastolic and systolic BP through the suppression of PRA that       is linked to downstream suppresion of angiotensin II formation, which further decreases the       sympathetic outflow that leads to hypertension. In addition to blood pressure lowering       properties, AC mycelia also has beneficial effect in reducing oxidative stress,       significantly.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This the first report undertaken to assess the effect of supplementation with oral       gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA, adenosine and antrosterol-containing AC mycelia on blood       pressure among people with mild hypertension. Forty-one subjects with systolic blood       pressure SBP between 130 and 179 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure DBP between 85       and 109 mm Hg were randomized to receive either AC mycelia or starch placebo for 8 weeks,       and had follow-up observation for an additional 2 weeks. SBP in the subjects given GABA,       adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia significantly decreased compared to those who       received the placebo p<0.05. DBP also decreased after the intake of AC mycelia. Compared       to the placebo, AC mycelia significantly reduced plasma renin activity by a maximum of 25 %       and 36 % on week 8. This suppression suggested that AC mycelia is a potent inhibitor of       renin, and its bioavailability is sufficient to produce BP reduction after a short term of       oral administration. Neither adverse events nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted       throughout the study period, suggesting that GABA, adenosine and antrosterol-rich AC mycelia       significantly decreased borderline hypertension, which may support its consideration as a       safe alternative treatment compared to conventional anti-hypertensive medications.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02548715","TITLE:       Levothyroxine Treatment for Subclinical Hypothyroidism After Head and Neck Surgery SUMMARY:       Patients that require treatment for cancers of the head and neck often require a combination       of surgery and/or radiation and chemotherapy. Hypothyroidism is one of the most common       complications, and has been associated with post-operative complications such as wound       healing problems, fistula formation, and decreased quality of life and survival. Several       studies have examined hypothyroidism after radiation to the head and neck, but few have       examined this after non-thyroid head and neck surgery. Head and neck resection is theorized       to devascularize the thyroid, thus resulting in post-operative hypothyroidism.        Synthroid is a synthetic thyroid hormone often used in cases of patients with proven       hypothyroidism and after surgical thyroid removal. Its use has been in effect and studied       for over fifty years.        Treatment algorithms for hypothyroidism are well published. However, treatment of       subclinical hypothyroidism elevated TSH with normal or near-normal T3/T4 is controversial.       The rate of subclinical hypothyroidism after non-thyroid head and neck surgery is high up       to 20%, and is associated with post-operative complications as noted above.        Therefore the investigators propose a double blinded randomized controlled trial comparing       outcomes of patients that develop subclinical hypothyroidism after head and neck surgery,       who are given a standardized dose of synthroid treatment versus those treated with placebo.       The main outcomes to be examined are post-operative complications wound healing issues,       fistula formation, survival, and quality of life measures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Background and Scope:        Hypothyroidism is one of the most common complications following multimodality treatment for       head and neck cancer, with an incidence of 7-58% depending on the subsite. The causes for       this high rate of hypothyroidism following treatment for head and neck cancer are       multifactorial. Patients treated for head and neck cancer often require radiation therapy       RT. The negative effects of RT on the thyroid are well published, and the resultant       hypothyroidism can have widespread implications on a patients physical and mental health.       Head and neck surgery has also been hypothesized to devascularize and disturb the overall       anatomical structure of the thyroid, thus contributing to the high incidence of       hypothyroidism after surgery.        Despite the literature demonstrating the connection between head and neck cancer treatment       and hypothyroidism, complications from this illness after major head and neck surgery remain       common. Decreased survival as well as increased rates of fistulas, infections, and wound       breakdown are some of the physical consequences. Other possible issues include decreased       functional outcomes and increased mental illness, as these are known consequences of       untreated hypothyroidism. While several studies have examined the rate and timing of       hypothyroidism after radiation to the head and neck, there is a paucity of literature on the       effect of surgery on thyroid function. Specifically, in patients treated with single       modality surgery, and in patients treated with primary surgery before the start of RT, when       the risk of wound complications is high.        Synthroid is a synthetic thyroid hormone, and is the mainstay of treatment of patients with       proven hypothyroidism and after surgical thyroid removal. Its use has been in effect and       studied for over fifty years. Side effects of the drug most commonly occur with overdosing       and will mimic those of hyperthyroidism, which may include: heart palpitations, abdominal       pain, nausea, anxiety, confusion, agitation, insomnia, weight loss, and increased appetite.       There is a low chance < 1% of allergic reaction to the drug, which may include shortness       of breath, swelling of the face and tongue.        Whereas treatment algorithms for clinical hypothyroidism are well established, treatment of       subclinical hypothyroidism remains controversial. Subclinical hypothyroidism refers to a       state of elevated thyroid stimulating hormone TSH, with normal or near-normal thyroid       hormone levels T3 and T4, or a lack of symptoms of hypothyroidism. Endocrinologists       disagree on whether this disease should be treated, since it is almost always asymptomatic,       and the treatment is mainly for relief of symptoms. Head and neck cancer patients, however,       represent a special population, in which the effects of subclinical hypothyroidism can       result in consequences besides symptoms, such as wound healing issues and fistula       development as described above. Studies have shown that the rate of subclinical       hypothyroidism during head and neck cancer treatment is high.        Therefore the investigators propose a single blinded randomized controlled trial comparing       outcomes of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, who are given a standardized dose of       synthroid treatment after head and neck surgery versus those treated with conventional       therapy. A secondary goal of this study is to determine the rate of clinical and subclinical       hypothyroidism after surgical treatment for head and neck cancer, without RT or before the       start of RT.        Objectives:        Primary Objectives:          -  To assess the effect synthroid treatment in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism            following head and neck surgery and its effects on survival, gastrostomy tube G-tube            rates, fistula formation, wound breakdown, and infection.        Secondary Objectives          -  To determine the rate of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism after surgery for head            and neck cancer          -  To determine the factors that are predictive of the development of clinical and            subclinical hypothyroidism after surgery for head and neck cancer        Methods:        This is a single-center double blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effects of       synthroid treatment immediately after surgery for head and neck cancer. Patient meeting       eligibility criteria will be identified at the time of booking for surgery and approached by       a member of the research team.        Data will be collected from the medical records on the variables under study in       study-specific data sheets. Data sheets will then be de-identified and input into a secure       database that will be password protected hard drive in a room that is locked. Data will then       be exported for statistical analysis when collection is complete.        The population will be comprised of patients who underwent surgery with or without a       combination of RT and/or chemotherapy for the treatment of non-thyroid head and neck cancer.       Surgery is defined as surgical resection with primary closure or reconstruction with       loco-regional flaps or autogenous free tissue transfer. RT is defined as curative dose       therapy. Chemotherapy is defined as any single agent therapy or combination of cisplatin or       carboplatin. Patients will be prospectively enrolled starting from March 1, 2015 until March       1, 2016. The expected accrual of this patient group will be 200 patients. The demographics       of head and neck mucosal cancers indicate that the male : female ratio will be 3 : 1 and the       mean age will be approximately 60 years with a range of 18 - 85 years.        In order to assess pre- and post-operative thyroid function, each patient will undergo blood       testing including TSH, free T3, and free T4 levels one week prior to surgery, and weekly       following surgery, up to 8 weeks post-operatively if not receiving radiation, or until 8       weeks after the start of radiation if receiving radiation therapy.        Patients will be classified into normal normal TSH and normal free T3 and free T4       levels, hypothyroid elevated TSH, decreased free T3 and free T4, or subclinical       hypothyroid elevated TSH 4-10mIU/L, normal free T3 and free T4.        Patients with normal thyroid function will not be randomized to any treatment arm, but       their post-operative outcomes will be recorded, according to section 8.0. Patients who are       hypothyroid will be treated for their hypothyroidism according to the standard of care, in       keeping with American Thyroid Association ATA / American Association of Clinical       Endocrinologists AACE guidelines.

Design: Parallel-group Double-blind Randomized Clinical Trial Pilot Study. Setting: AGU       Complejo Hospitalario Universitario from Albacete Albacete, Spain.        Participants: 50 patients ≥ 65 years hospitalized in the AGU 21 intervention group, 29       control group.        Interventions: After risk factor analysis, all participants in the intervention group IG       received a daily multicomponent intervention orientation, sensorial deficit, sleep,       mobilization, hydration, nutrition, drugs, elimination, oxygenation, pain by the       intervention nurses. The control group CG received usual care.        Measurements: Delirium presence was determined daily with the Confusion Assessment Method       CAM, and delirium severity with the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 DRS. Mortality,       days of hospitalization, use of physical restraint measures, and use of drugs for delirium       control neuroleptics and benzodiacepines were also recorded. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Parallel-group, double blind evaluation and analysis, randomized clinical trial pilot       study. The design was based on recommendations for conducting pilot studies Thabane 2010.        The main objective of the MID-Nurse Randomized Clinical Trial was to analyze if a       multicomponent nurse-led intervention reduces the incidence, duration, and severity of       delirium in hospitalized older adults in an Acute Geriatric Unit AGU.        Specific objectives and evaluating criteria of the MID-Nurse-P Pilot Study were:          -  Process: To determine the recruitment rate criteria: at least 70% of the eligible            patients can be recruited, the complete follow-up rate criteria: at least 85% of the            included participants complete the follow-up, and the adherence to intervention            criteria: at least 80% of the included participants receive every scheduled            intervention.          -  Resources: To assess capacity of the team and process time to conduct the trial.            Criteria: Less than 10% of the participants can´t complete the intervention program due            to study team problems, and daily time employed per participant is not longer than 30            minutes.          -  Management: To analyze potential study personnel and data managing problems.          -  Scientific: To estimate the intervention effect and the variance.        In the first 24 hours from admission, all the following data were collected by the       evaluation nurses, once the informed consent was signed, and randomization performed by the       principal investigator, who did not take part in the rest of the data collection and       clinical intervention: Demographic data, Charlson comorbidity index, mean clinical diagnosis       for admission, usually consumed drugs before admission, Barthel index, Holden´s FAC       instrument, Pfeiffer´s Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Reisberg´s Global       Deterioration Scale, Dowton scale, pain with the visual analogical scale, and pressure       ulcers risk with the Braden scale. Vital signs were determined on admission, including blood       pressure, heart rate, temperature, hydration level, and oxygen saturation. Medical or nurse       procedures were recorded, including bladder catheterization, nasogastric tube placement,       venous or arterial access, blood sample acquisition, and other invasive procedures.        Blood sample was collected, and haemoglobin, leukocyte and neutrophil count, reactive C       protein, sedimentation rate, glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, albumin, total proteins,       cholesterol, thyroid stimulating hormone, transferrin, ferritin, total iron, folic acid, and       B12 vitamin, were recorded.        After patient enrollment, all the patients received daily an evaluation of the Confusion       Assessment Method scale CAM Inouye 1990 by the evaluation nurses, in the afternoon.       Prevalence of delirium throughout the follow-up was described, prevalence excluding the       first day to avoid bias of patients that were admitted with confusion, and incidence of       delirium new case across the follow-up, one patient could have more than 1 incident       delirium. Number of days with delirium were also registered, and mean number of days with       delirium was calculated for both groups.        In the case that the CAM was positive for delirium, patients also were evaluated with the       Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 DRS-R-98 de Rooij 2006 to determine delirium severity.       Total delirium severity was calculated by adding the severity of delirium during all days of       hospitalization, and mean severity per day was calculated dividing the global severity per       number of days with delirium.        Main outcome variables were the presence of delirium throughout the follow-up dichotomic       variable, yes/no, number of days with delirium during hospitalization continuous       variable, and total delirium severity sum of DRS-R-98 during the complete follow-up.        Participants in the intervention group received the first intervention in the first 24 hours       from admission, and thereafter daily until hospital discharge. Participants in the control       group received usual medical and nurse care during all the hospitalization process. The       intervention was carried out exclusively by the intervention nurses, and was composed of       two main parts, being the first one a risk factor analysis, and the second one the       intervention on the risk factors detected orientation, sensorial deficit, sleep,       mobilization, hydration, nutrition, drugs, elimination, oxygenation, pain. Furthermore, the       intervention nurses identified the principal caregiver in the first 24 hours from admission,       and provided an informative booklet about strategies and recommendations to prevent delirium       incidence, including ambient strategies, orientation abilities, and identification of alert       signs.

Treatment of delirium has been       unsatisfactory and prevention is the preferred goal. Based on limited experimental research,       ramelteon appears to have promise for prevention. This study will evaluate ramelteon in       prevention of delirium in a hospitalized adult population age 65+ in a double-blinded RCT. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Delirium is a very common condition that is associated with significant complications in       hospitalized adults.        The manifestations of delirium are the result of a disturbance of brain functioning, the       causes of which include a very wide array of illnesses, intoxications, and stresses.       Delirium has been estimated to affect 20-50% of hospitalized patients, and to be associated       with longer hospital stay 2x, greater likelihood of discharge to nursing home 2x, and       higher rate of death 2x. 20% have delirium on admission. Patients who experience delirium       may have persistent confusion cognitive impairment. In 20%, this confusion appears to be       permanent. Treatment of delirium has been unsatisfactory. Once it develops, no therapy or       intervention has demonstrated a meaningful reduction of delirium associated complications.       Prevention is clearly the preferred goal. Based on limited reports, ramelteon appears to       have the most promise for prevention. Ramelteon, FDA approved 2005 as a nonscheduled       prescription hypnotic agent, is generally considered safe and effective with no serious       associated side effects, and no limitation of duration of use. It is related to melatonin in       action and shares sleep promoting effects reduced sleep latency and improvement in       coordination of circadian cycles. A recent randomized placebo-controlled single blinded       trial of ramelteon treated 33 patients with ramelteon 8 mg/d. The researchers reported that       ramelteon was associated with a dramatically lower risk of delirium 3% vs 32%; P = .003,       with a relative risk of 0.09. Estimates of time to develop delirium were delayed for       ramelteon compared to placebo, and the frequency of delirium was significantly lower in       ramelteon compared to placebo P = .002. There were significant limitations of this study,       however, including a very high exclusion rate 1059 of 1126 [94%] patients assessed were       excluded, a 24+ hour delay in initiation of study agent, a small sample size, and unclear       sampling bias. The investigators propose a clinical trial of ramelteon to prevent delirium       in patients admitted to Hartford Hospital. Hartford Hospital is in a unique position to       conduct this study having established the ADAPT program to systematically apply best       practices to the assessment and management of delirium. A registry of patients screened       contains all of the screening results over 1.5 million CAM screens on nearly 91,000       patients. Our study will permit us to evaluate the recent limited research findings       regarding ramelteon in a larger general adult hospitalized population, and evaluate the       potential benefit of treatment started earlier in the course of a hospitalization.

And to develop a strategy for the assessment and treatment of patients with T1D       and an increased risk for development of psychopathology under stress. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       Lately, a marked increase in the incidence and earlier age of onset of type 1 diabetes T1D       has been noted. These observations could also be connected to an increased prevalence of       stressful experiences and a lowered stress tolerance in some children.        The way a person responds to stress is determined by the interplay of genetic and       environmental factors. Environmental experiences at specific times of development have been       shown to shape individuals hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis HPA axis stress response.       It is known, that early development of central nervous system is critically dependent on       childs interaction with the environment experience dependent maturation, especially to       the attachment to caregivers most often the mother. Appropriate caregiving is connected to       lower basal cortisol levels in children and a more stable HPA axis response after the       exposure to stress. Any circumstances that disturbed the formation of the attachment to the       primary caregiver e.g. complications at delivery, psychosocial stressors affecting the       mother or mothers postpartum depression resulted in higher HPA axis responsiveness to       stress in the affected children.        Changes in individual genes have also been shown to influence a persons susceptibility to       stress and risk for the development of stress-induced psychopathology.

Despite decades of promising preclinical and       clinical investigations in trauma, investigators understanding of these entities is still       incomplete, and few therapies have shown success. During severe trauma, bone marrow       granulocyte stores are rapidly released into the peripheral circulation. This release       subsequently induces the expansion and repopulation of empty or evacuated space by       hematopoietic stem cells HSCs. Although the patient experiences an early loss of bone       marrow myeloid-derived cells, stem cell expansion is largely skewed towards the repopulation       of the myeloid lineage/compartment. The hypothesis is that this emergency myelopoiesis is       critical for the survival of the severely traumatized and further, failure of the emergency       myelopoietic response is associated with global immunosuppression and susceptibility to       secondary infection. Also, identifying the release of myeloid derived suppressor cells       MDSCs in the circulation of human severe trauma subjects. This process is driven by HSCs       in the bone marrow of trauma subjects. Additionally, MDSCs may have a profound effect on the       nutritional status of the host. The appearance of these MDSCs after trauma is associated       with a loss of muscle tissue in these subjects. This muscle loss and possible increased       catabolism have huge effects on long term outcomes for these subjects. It is the       investigators goal to understand the differences that occur in these in HSCs and muscle       cells as opposed to non-injured and non-infected controls. This work will lead to a better       understanding of the myelopoietic and catabolic response following trauma. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       This is a prospective study to understand how trauma injuries changes the hematopoeitic stem       cells HSCs in the bone marrow and muscle cells after trauma injury in elderly subjects is       different when compared to non-injured subjects.        There will be three groups for this study: 1 Elective hip surgery subjects, 2 Trauma       subjects and 3 deidentified bone marrow of healthy controls.        Samples of bone marrow, muscle tissue, and a blood sample will be collected at the time of       surgery. The deidentified bone marrow of healthy controls will come from a tissue bank.        The blood will be used to perform PB colony assays, ELISAs to test for the following       parameters: EPO, G-CSF, Reticulocyte, iron levels and cytokines and inflammatory markers.        The bone marrow, muscle tissue, blood samples will be processed and sorted to isolate       hematopoeitic stem cells for genomic content to determine genomic expression, oxidative       stress, mitochondrial activity, apoptosis, autophagy, analysis of circulating erythroid       progenitor cells, reticulocytes, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor assays,       erythropoietin and iron levels.        Clinical data and hemodynamic measurements will be collected daily while subjects are       hospitalized and trauma surgery subjects will be followed to evaluate for malunion and       subsequent additional surgical procedures for repair.

Especially, the investigators want to investigate if an imitated natural light/dark cycle       influences frequency of delirium. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       A common problem for patients in the ICU is episodes of delirium. Recent trials have       described incidences ranging from 60-87% of patients in a number of different countries.       Delirium is a condition with fluctuating conscience, disorganized thinking and disturbance       of the sleep/wake cycle. Many patients with delirium experience hallucinations and agitation       which can be very unpleasant for both patients and their families.        Some risk factors for the development of delirium well known, e.g. dementia, hypertension,       illness severity SAPS II score, delirium on the previous day, mechanical ventilation,       emergency surgery and metabolic acidosis. The effect of sedative drug administration is not       clear, as studies has been inconclusive.        Even though studies regarding the impact of sleep deprivation on development of delirium       have been inconclusive, there is no doubt that delirious patients have a disturbed       sleep-wake cycle, sleep architecture and circadian rhythm.        At the intensive care unit at the Department of Anesthesiology at Køge Hospital, three out       of nine rooms have a simulated circadian light installed. The idea is that this light rhythm       may help to keep a natural circadian rhythm, minimizing the risk of delirium.        With this descriptive and retrospective cohort study, the investigators therefore want to       describe the incidence and possible risk- and preventive factors of delirium for the       participants ICU patients at Køge Hospital, and with a special focus on the possible       effect of imitated circadian light..

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02615834","TITLE:       Chest Pressure for Intubated Peds Patients SUMMARY:       We previously showed that a gentle chest pressure technique could be used on children over a       year old to generate around 20% of the volume of air inhaled or exhaled in a single normal       breath also known as tidal volume. This showed that a non-invasive method could be used to       provide a temporary means of artificial breathing, meaning that invasive procedures, such as       putting in a breathing tube, could be avoided. What our results did not tell us, however, is       how much oxygen can get to peripheral tissues e.g., arms, legs with this method. In this       study, we want to compare two groups of children. All children will have a breathing tube;       one group will have gentle chest pressure performed on them to see if oxygen saturations can       be maintained above 90%. The other group will receive no chest pressure. We will see how       long it takes for oxygen levels in both groups to drop to 90%, at which point, the patient       will be ventilated mechanically. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       BACKGROUND Airway management is different in the pediatric population compared to adults       mainly due to the differences in respiratory physiology and anatomy. The oxygen consumption       is about three times as high in children than in adults resulting in a higher impact on       oxygen delivery and reserve should there be a problem with ventilation in children. During       inspiration, the vertical dimension of the chest cavity is increased and the rib margins are       lifted and moved out, causing an increase in the transverse diameter of the thorax. This       generates a negative pressure in the intrapleural space between the lungs and the chest wall       resulting in lung inflation. The rib cages of young children are very pliable. One of the       theoretical ways to improve the efficiency of lung inflation in small children with such       compliant rib cage is to apply pressure on the chest. The intrathoracic pressure increases       above atmospheric pressure and air preferentially flows out of the lungs according to the       pressure gradient. When the pressure on the chest is released and the thorax recoils       passively springs open, a negative intrathoracic pressure is generated. This effectively       sucks air into the lungs along the pressure gradient. Although age-related pliability       differences may be present, we do not expect this to be a significant factor in using the       chest pressure technique successfully.        We previously demonstrated that application of gentle pressure on the right chest of       pediatric patients generated 20% of the tidal volume achieved with mechanical ventilation,       regardless of whether the patient was intubated or not. Chest pressure was monitored using a       force transducer and did not exceed the patients body weight. Indeed, the pressure used was       considerably less than what would be administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.       There was little variation across age ranges; for each age group, we observed a difference       of less than 1 mL/kg compared to the overall mean tidal volume. Our study also showed that       the gentle chest pressure technique was well-tolerated by pediatric patients of any age       neonate to adolescent, and no adverse events were encountered, supporting this technique       as a very low-risk maneuver.        While these results are encouraging, the study did not provide detailed information on how       much peripheral oxygenation SpO2 is achieved with the gentle chest pressure technique. An       editorial that accompanied the published study supports further investigation of the       technique, including the extent to which it provides ventilation and its ability to provide       adequate oxygenation. In this study, we wish to perform the technique on pediatric patients       to determine if it can be used to maintain SpO2 for a significant length of time. For safety       purposes, all trials will be done on patients whose tracheae have been intubated.        OBJECTIVE To determine if a gentle chest pressure technique can be used to maintain SpO2       over 90% significantly longer than allowing SpO2 to desaturate spontaneously.        HYPOTHESIS Gentle chest pressure can maintain SpO2 over 90% for significantly longer than if       tissues are allowed to desaturate spontaneously.        METHODS After obtaining ethics approval, informed consent with or without assent whenever is       appropriate usually above the age of 6 years will be obtained on the day ward. Consent       will be obtained by a research assistant not involved with the clinical care of the patient.       The demographic details of the patients, such as age, weight, height, ASA and any medical       conditions will be recorded. The patient will be taken into the operating room, and routine       monitoring will be applied. After induction of a standard general anesthesia where the       technique is at the discretion of each individual anesthesiologist responsible for the case,       the patients trachea will be intubated. The patient will be ventilated mechanically for two       minutes to achieve 100% peripheral oxygen saturation.        During this time, the patient will be randomly allocated to one of two groups - intervention       and control - by a member of the study team. Instructions in sealed envelopes will indicate       whether the chest pressure technique will be used or not. For patients in the intervention       group, the anesthesiologist will apply gentle pressure not exceeding the patients own       weight vertically down on the patients right chest. In the previous study, we calibrated       pressure using a force transducer; since then, the Stollery pediatric anesthesia staff has       been employing the technique in regular practice and are well experienced with the amount of       force needed to generate adequate tidal volume. Since a pre-defined distance to depress the       chest e.g., 1 or 2 cm is difficult to use for a wide range of patients weights       approximately 9-67 kg range in the previous study, in this study, the anesthesiologist       will apply pressure to the point where resistance is encountered and then release. Upon       release of pressure, the anesthesiologist will wait for one second. In our experience, the       time taken to apply downward pressure and allow for chest recoil lasts approximately four       seconds which, with the one second pause following pressure release, creates a total time of       5 seconds for the entire maneuver. As such, the maneuver can be used to achieve 12 breaths       per minute. Oxygen saturation will be monitored and recorded continuously. The time taken       for SpO2 levels to fall to 90% will be recorded, at which point, the anesthesiologist will       restart mechanical ventilation. If SpO2 values fall below 90% at any time while the chest       pressure technique is being performed, the patient can be ventilated mechanically       immediately because they are already intubated.        Patients randomized to the control group will receive the same care as the intervention       group except that no chest pressure technique will be performed. Following mechanical       ventilation to 100% SpO2, surgery will proceed as normal with no additional intervention       i.e., gentle chest pressure by the anesthesiologist. Peripheral oxygen saturations will be       monitored during this time, and once the level reaches 90%, the time will be recorded, and       the anesthesiologist will restart mechanical ventilation.

Almost 90% of ulcers recur within 3 months of healing. During the six-month       randomized clinic trial, skin temperature will be monitored daily, a maintenance dose of       cooling gel pack or placebo will be applied three times weekly to the affected skin, and a       bolus dose of cooling will be applied for 5 consecutive days if skin temperature becomes       elevated. Outcomes on the incidence of leg ulcer recurrence, pain, physical activity and       quality of life will be measured. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The goal of this randomized control trial is to test a patient directed self-monitoring and       self-management intervention aimed at preventing the recurrence of chronic venous leg and       diabetic foot ulcers using skin temperature and cryotherapy cooling. This MUSTCOOL study       is a novel ulcer prevention strategy for patients at highest risk for developing chronic       ulcers; those with a previous history. The aims are to compare a cooling treatment to a       placebo to determine the outcomes on ulcer recurrence, pain, physical activity and quality       of life.        Individuals with newly healed chronic ulcers will be invited to participate in MUSTCOOLs       two component intervention:          1. self monitoring skin temperature over targeted hot spots daily with an infrared            thermometer; and          2. maintenance cooling with a cooling pack or placebo pack placed over the hot spot            three times each week for 30 minutes. If the temperature of the hot spot becomes            elevated 2°F above baseline average of 30 days of daily temperature readings for 2            days in a row, a bolus regimen of 5 consecutive daily, 30 minute applications of the            cooling or placebo pack will be implemented. The safety and side effects will be            monitored, however, there have been no reported adverse events reported in our previous            cryotherapy studies.        This study was designed as a chronic ulcer prevention intervention that targets the       remodeling phase, the final repair process of healing after chronic ulcer closure. The skin       environment is particularly vulnerable to ulcer recurrence due to a persistent aberrant       inflammatory state. The previous research conducted by the study team has demonstrated that       cooling this skin reduces the abnormal metabolic activity, protecting it against ulcer       recurrence. Recent advancements in infrared technology allow us to take images of the affect       skin to identify the area that has the highest temperature or vulnerable hot spot. These       hot spots will be self monitored by patients with newly healed ulcers in the home with an       infrared thermometer that date and time stamps each reading. The studys outcomes on       physical activity will be evaluated with an accelerometer. It is hypothesized that by       improving the skin environment and reducing pain, patients will more likely be physically       active and have better quality of life, all measurable goals for this study.        This prevention strategy will be evaluated over six months in 180 patients, 90 of whom will       be randomized to receive the cooling pack and 90 the placebo. The goal is to test this       non-pharmacological, non-invasive clinical intervention as a tailored self-management       strategy to prevent chronic ulcer recurrence. It will also determine alleviation of symptoms       such as pain, and the debilitating effects on physical activity and quality of life.

INSERT INTO main_document ( name, content) VALUES ("NCT02627937","TITLE:       Clinical Predictors of Pediatric OSAHS SUMMARY:       The purpose of this study is to develop adequate and satisfactory tools using reliable       clinical and physical factors in predicting pediatric obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea       syndrome OSAHS and allow greater access to appropriate therapy in children. DETAILED DESCRIPTION:       The prevalence of OSAHS is estimated to be about 1% to 4% in children, however, it is       frequently underdiagnosed because of the difficulties for evaluation.Current diagnostic       approaches are based on the patients history, clinical presentation and physical       examination, endoscopy, and radiological imaging examinations, and confirmation is made by       the current gold standard of full-night polysomnography PSG. Previous studies have       reported the use of a clinical history, physical examination and questionnaires for       predicting pediatric OSAHS but there were lacking of adequate and satisfactory results.       Despite the potential diagnostic benefits, PSG for pediatric patients are not routinely used       in clinical practice. Therefore, to obtain a reliable, valid, and easily-performed       diagnostic or screening tool for the clinical assessment of pediatric OSAHS is essential for       the cost-effective care of these patients. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:       Inclusion Criteria:            -  children younger than 18 years old and older than 2 years old with symptoms of              snoring and then were confirmed to having obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome              by a comprehensive polysomnography          Exclusion Criteria:            -  patients with substance abuse problems or the long-term usage of medications known to              affect sleep, craniofacial abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, Down syndrome,              cerebral palsy, mucopolysaccharidoses, Prader-Willi syndrome, history of psychosis,              central sleep apnea syndrome, or previous airway surgery including tonsillectomy              and/or adenoidectomy were excluded from the study.
